The Times has learned that some senior anti-Zuma NEC members were told to leave the meeting.And sources have said that former national police commissioner Bheki Cele and former police minister Nathi Mthwetwa, who are in Zuma's cabinet in other positions, nearly exchanged blows at the meeting on Sunday.The party had to extend the final NEC meeting of the year, held at the StGeorge's Hotel in Pretoria, to yesterday after disagreements between pro- and anti-Zuma ANC members who differed strongly on the motion of no confidence in Zuma proposed by Minister of Tourism Derek Hanekom.Ministers: we will quit if Zuma staysHanekom was harshly criticised by Zuma sympathisers, with some expressing their views on social media. Party insiders yesterday said Hanekom's motion was strongly opposed, placing his position in Zuma's cabinet in peril.One source said that among senior ANC members who were told by others to resign from the cabinet and parliament were Hanekom, Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi, Minister of Science and Technology Naledi Pandor, Minister of Public Works Thulas Nxesi, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Insiders told The Times that Sunday was a day of high drama, with cabinet ministers turning on each other in defence of, or against, Zuma.Bheki Cele, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, apparently annoyed Mthethwa, Minister of Arts andCulture, when he pointed out that the Marikana tragedy happened on Mthethwa's watch in August 2012.At the time Mthethwa was minister of police and Cele had just been fired as national police commissioner.Cele suggested that the ANC was in trouble because of a lack of accountability, sources said.Sources at the meeting claimed that Cele's comments angered Mthethwa, who retorted angrily.Cele responded by saying: "Are you threatening me?"It is understood that yesterday when NEC members made individual submissions there was a stalemate between the two factions until Zuma left to receive Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. He later returned.Zuma supporters called on the president to fire ministers who had called on him to resign, saying there was a clear breakdown of trust.Others described the meeting as "tough", "personal" and "tense". Zuma detractors were lambasted for speaking against him."There were many comrades that had not made submissions hence the meeting had to be extended. NEC members were making individual submissions and that is when people expressed their views of dissatisfaction against the president," said a source.Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni said the challenge to Zuma from within the party is a clear sign that he is losing power.DA pounces on deep divisions at #ANCNEC"The momentum of the veterans and other roleplayers can only mean one thing. Cosatu also pronounced on a candidate that is not necessarily [Zuma's] choice, (Cyril Ramaphosa)," Fikeni said.However, he said, Zuma still had some staying power and would probably survive the motion proposed against him."He will in all likelihood survive this one, limping and wounded, but he might also go on a vengeful mission. That might cause even more negative reaction," he said.The battle for the soul of the ANC has not been this fiercely contested since the party unceremoniously dumped President Thabo Mbeki.The discussion by the NEC into Zuma's fitness to continue as head of state exposes a rift within the party's highest decision-making structure between conferences, the NEC, which has consistently defended him in the past.Political analyst at the University of Cape Town Zwelethu Jolobe said the move by some in the ANC to call for Zuma's head showed that they no longer trusted him."This shows that the ANC operates under the principle of collective leadership. Whenever there are challenges, the most important accountable body is the NEC. So now the NEC is showing that the party president is indeed accountable to the NEC," Jolobe said.Recently ANC MPs voted against a motion of no confidence in Zuma proposed by DA leader Mmusi Maimane.The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has criticised Hanekom's NEC motion."It doesn't sound logical that NEC members can go around canvassing for the president to be removed, while they were elected together by the conference of the ANC," said ANC KwaZulu-Natal spokesman Mdumiseni Ntuli.Despite the impasse over his leadership, Zuma continued with business as usual, issuing a statement that he would host Museveni."The two heads of state are expected to review co-operation between their countries as well as the latest regional political and security developments on the continent," the statement read.Later, a statement was released saying Zuma would travel to Cuba for the funeral of former president Fidel Castro on Friday.
