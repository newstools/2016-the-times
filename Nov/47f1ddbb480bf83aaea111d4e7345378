But the deficit at R4.41bn was much smaller than the R9.5bn-R10.5bn expected by economists surveyed by Trading Economics and Bloomberg and compared with September s revised R6.95bn surplus (revised from the R6.7bn reported in October).Exports of R88.19bn in September were offset by imports of R92.6bn.For the year to date the deficit is R14.35bn a vast improvement on the R59.5bn deficit seen at this time last year.Capital Economics' John Ashbourne said the deficit was much lower than expected driven largely by a drop in imports. A closer look at the figures shows that today s data are a very worrying result for SA. He said we may be looking at a very weak economy in the fourth quarter as imports had not been this low since at least 2011 .Exports of gold diamonds and other precious metals and stones fell 25% from September to October.Exports of vegetable products almost halved falling 48%. But SA also imported less in this sector with a 26% fall in imports of vegetable products.TMG Digital/BusinessLive
