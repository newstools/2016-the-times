The company said the restrictions have been prompted by a need to curb water usage at some of the reservoir sites that are experiencing high consumption. The intention is to build up reservoir levels and prevent further water shortages that are caused by demand exceeding supply since the announcement of water restrictions by the Department of Water and Sanitation. Johannesburg is still under level 2 water restrictions despite the recent rainfall. Water levels at the Integrated Vaal River system have not risen sufficiently to above satisfactory levels Joburg Water said in a statement.The valves of reservoirs supplying the affected areas will be turned off between 8pm on Wednesday evening and 4am on Thursday. This is a method that we have successfully used to stabilise supply in areas around Lenasia Northcliff Fairlands and Blackheath which were struggling with supply in the past weeks. One other factor that contributed to our success in these areas is consumers who have since reduced their consumption significantly the statement read.The Johannesburg Metro Police Department is expected to continue monitoring wasteful water usage and has thus far issued a total of 451 fines to consumers found contravening the water services by-law.
