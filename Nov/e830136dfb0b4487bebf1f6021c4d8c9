The day before, South African hopefuls had been beaten into fourth spot on three occasions - the women's hockey team, Johan Cronj in the 1 500m and the men's 4x100m relay team - and Moolman-Pasio looked as if she would suffer the same fate when Cromwell attacked her hard in the charge for the line.It was so close that Moolman-Pasio thought she had lost the tussle, but a photo-finish showed that her front wheel got there by half-a-tyre."I thought I finished fourth and then I was told by my team that I finished third. I couldn't believe it," she beamed."It was very close on the line. It was a great race with a great crowd."The seven-lap course through the overcast city centre had a bit of everything, and required the cyclists to climb and strategise.That's what made Moolman-Pasio's performance so incredible. With her five team-mates far behind, she was the lone ranger in the front group, taking on two Olympic silver medallists from England and two Australians.Lizzie Armistead of England won in 2hr 38min and 43sec, 25 seconds ahead of team-mate Emma Pooley.Moolman-Pasio was 1:11 behind the victor. An-Li Kachelhoffer was the only other South African rider to finish, in 22nd place.Team SA ended the Commonwealth Games with a total of 40 medals, their second-best behind the 46 they won in Manchester 2002, and not far behind the target of 43.South Africa's tally featured 13 golds, their highest of the post-isolation era, but their ranking dropped to seventh on the medals table, down from fifth at Delhi 2010 and Melbourne 2006.
