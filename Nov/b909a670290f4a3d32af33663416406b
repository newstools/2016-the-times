The party s Zizi Kodwa said on Thursday that it appreciated that the people have reaffirmed their support of the ANC ensuring that we win . These results are yet another show of continued confidence by the electorate in the ANC and our programme of fundamental socio-economic transformation he added. Their confidence in the ANC has not is not and will never be taken for granted. However Kodwa said the party was grave concernly that according to the statistics released by the Independent Electoral Commission of the 97 385 registered population only 42 368 votes were cast amounting to 43.51% voter turnout . For almost 105 years the ANC working with the people has led the struggle for the liberation of all the people of South Africa in which they can all black or white enjoy the constitutional right to elect the government of their choice. Many sacrificed their lives for the right to vote. We should never fail them by staying away from voting. TMG Digital
