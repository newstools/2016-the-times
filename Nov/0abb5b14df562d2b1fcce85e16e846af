This comes as the drought has brought home not only the extent of the country s water scarcity but also the dire state of its water infrastructure and the state s constrained ability to repair and fund it."We will be looking into convening a water infrastructure investment conference where we will be sharing with the world - starting with our own business people and suppliers - on the infrastructure opportunities that exist in the water sector so that individual organisations and businesses can come in and invest " said Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane.She was speaking at a media briefing after a meeting with the chairs of all nine water boards at a hotel in Kempton Park Johannesburg on Friday afternoon.The purpose of the meeting was to assess drought interventions the implementation of water restrictions and the management and implementation of major water and sanitation infrastructure projects."The infrastructure demand in the water sector can not only be funded through fiscals we also need the private sector to come to the party and we know that we've got mega projects (in a number of provinces) that will take partnerships for us to be able to win this battle against water security in our country " said Mokonyane.In Gauteng the Vaal Dam is currently 26% full. If this drops much more it will cause the dam's infrastructure to clog up Mokonyane warned.However preparations are in place to begin releasing water from the Sterkfontein Dam in the Free State into the Vaal Dam. The Sterkfontein Dam which holds reserved water has increased by 0.4% to 91.5% according to the minister.The entire Vaal River System consists of 14 dams which are sitting at 49%. These dams mainly service Gauteng s 13 million users.South Africa received its lowest rainfall since 1904 in 2015 with extremely high temperature experienced in October and November.This has severely affected the country's water supplies: the national average of dam levels is 48.4% compared with the same time last year when levels were at 66%.
