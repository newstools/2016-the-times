But thanks to an increasingly powerful, sinister cabal of hackers the sexually immoral are again being made to pay with hellfire.This week's revelation of the theft and publishing of 412 million accounts on "adult dating and pornography site" AdultFriendfinder is just the latest case.Along with the e-mail addresses, passwords and dates of last visit to the site of hapless suburban dudes and dudettes, over 80,000 military and US government e-mail addresses were leaked, too.This follows a previous hack last year on the site, in which the details of 4million users were stolen and published.Last year hackers calling themselves The Impact Group stole the details of 33million Ashley Madison profiles, and used them to blackmail the company into closing down immediately. When it didn't, it published them.More recently, Wikileaks has turned from leaking military secrets to spilling the contents of politicians' private e-mails.This is utterly bone chilling: further evidence of the growing moral authoritarianism of the evermore ambitious supra-governmental hacking "community".It's as though these hackers see themselves as a substitute for the vice police or 17th century witch-findersI recently met a hacker in San Francisco through a friend who works for a state organisation. This man, who didn't give me his real name, described himself as "the David Bowie of hacking".Skinny, slightly smelly, and keen to splash his cash on single malt and foie gras, he happened to be working for, not against, the state. But his arrogance was unmistakeable: he did, he said, just what he wanted, implying he could change allegiance at any time.It is ironic that the hackers' God-complex seems to be so focused on sex. Computing had been a forum for renegades, especially at the dawn of the internet.Exposing cheaters and people looking for sex is not only nasty, but a waste of energy.The clever cogs bent on punishing the users of AdultFriendFinder could be helping fend off Chinese intellectual property theft, for instance, or North Korea-sponsored subterfuge.But, you might say, the hackers are right. People who cheat deserve it, and those looking for strings-free hook-ups have no shame.This is to grossly miss the point. One of western modernity's great achievements has been to separate out non-coercive sex from legal and social judgment, siphoning it off as "lifestyle and relationships".Adultery may have been cause for death by stoning in the medieval Christian past, but now it's something couples deal with privately, with the option of separation and divorce.It would be nice if those with supreme computing skills could demonstrate a little humility, and keep their interest in people's sexual choices to debate over a few pints.- The Daily Telegraph
