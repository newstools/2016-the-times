The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) announced the progress it has made on the rehabilitation projects on Thursday.JRA managing director Sean Phillips said the delays are the result of geotechnical complications on the Oxford and Federation road bridges project near Killarney and financial difficulty on the Double Decker bridge project over the city centre.The Oxford and Federation road bridge construction was expected to be completed by February next year. The deadline has now been extended to September 2017. Striking workers also delayed work here for six weeks between April and August.The contractor on the Double Decker project experienced cash flow problems and was forced to stop construction for four months. That project is now expected to be completed by the end of 2017.It should have been completed by May 2017.While most of the work on this project takes place at night and does not affect peak-hour traffic the Oxford and Federation road construction sites will continue to see lane closures during the day.The Oxford Road offramp from the M1 travelling south will be closed until mid-December. The northbound Oxford Road offramp will be closed from March 2017 to September 2017.From the end of this month to January 15 Henry Nxumalo will have one lane closed for work on the Double Decker bridgeFrom January 22 to February 12 the Double Decker bridge will be reduced by one lane on both carriage ways.Transport MMC Nonhlanhla Makhuba thanked road users for their tolerance and urged motorists to remain patient and courteous on the roads .She asked Johannesburg residents to use alternative routes adjust travelling times and use public transport where possible.
