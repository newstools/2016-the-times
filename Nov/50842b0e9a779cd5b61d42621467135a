At a micro level, it represents yet another legal defeat for President Jacob Zuma, who withdrew his attempt to interdict the report when it was apparent that he was going to lose. In any other society, such a failed effort to interdict a state agency's corruption report would lead to resignation. Not with Zuma, though.At a macro level, it is a whole different story.This report is going to be severely damaging on two fronts:First, it is going to be a serious political embarrassment, laying bare the Zuma crony empire in all its glory, exposing his family's business interests and their entanglement with the Gupta family's empire and revealing the network of ministers and underlings who abuse their stations to effectively steal from the public purse.Second, it is going to lead to further institutional action. Thuli Madonsela is said to be calling for a full judicial inquiry (appointed by the Chief Justice, Mogoeng Mogoeng as Zuma will have to recuse himself for obvious reasons). Such an inquiry is likely to turn into a slow and painful public execution of Zuma which will drag on perhaps until the 2019 election, shredding the ANC's credibility to such an extent that it is hard to see how it will hang on to a majority.Read the full opinion piece on BusinessLIVE
