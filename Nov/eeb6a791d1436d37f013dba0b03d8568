This comes after a failed motion of no-confidence in mayor Thobeka Bikitsha speaker Zibuthe Mnqwazi and council chief whip Zakhele Mkiva on Tuesday.It was brought to council by an ANC faction aligned to suspended municipal manager Sindile Tantsi and opposition parties. The 33 councillors who signed a petition calling for the trio to resign wanted Tantsi to be reinstated.ANC provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane condemned the divisions in Mnquma and vowed that decisive action would be taken against ill-disciplined members.Asked if this meant recalling some councillors Mabuyane said that could not be ruled out."If it's necessary we'll remove the entire council. We'll create that precedent. We can't have councillors who continue being at each other's throats " he warned. All ANC councillors and deployees in government have been summoned to the party's provincial headquarters Calata House on Friday to reflect on the poor August election results and to unite divided caucuses. - TMG Digital/DispatchLIVE
