Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane filed an urgent interdict yesterday afternoon to prevent the release of the report on the grounds that he had not been afforded an opportunity to respond to the report's contents insofar as they relate to him.Zwane said he had not been given a chance to answer any allegations against him that may be contained in the report, adding that the public protector "cannot confirm or deny" if the report makes adverse findings against him.Only hours earlier Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Des van Rooyen filed court papers lambasting Madonsela for implicating him in state capture, even though her office had given assurances that no adverse findings would be made against him in the report.Van Rooyen originally sought to interdict the report, but withdrew his application on October 21 because he said the report did not implicate him."I was lulled into a false sense of security by the assurances given by the previous public protector and her apparent acceptance of the principle of audi alteram partem (listen to the other side)," Van Rooyen says in his court papers.Van Rooyen has asked the court to hear his application either before or simultaneously with that of President Jacob Zuma's, who on Saturday requested the court to postpone today's proceedings.Van Rooyen submitted that if the court did not grant his wish he would have the spectre of legally binding findings looming over him."lf the relief I seek is not granted I will suffer irreparable harm. The public Protector's investigation into the Gupta family has attracted an enormous amount of publicity in the media and public interest. The publication of adverse findings against me, which I have not had a reasonable opportunity fully to deal with and rebut, will inevitably cause grave damage to my reputation and will put me in peril of the sanctions appropriate to those conclusions and even to the possibility of criminal charges."Newspaper reports critical of me are one thing, but a binding finding by the public protector is another."While I can conceivably ignore the former, I cannot ignore the latter," Van Rooyen said.The Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters are among those who have joined the case.
