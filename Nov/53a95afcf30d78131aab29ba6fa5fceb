Mili Sefala from Daveyton left work before 5pm but her car first overheated then took on water when she was driving in the storm near a small dam in Bonaero Park."My car kept indicating that I check the engine. I drove back to work and called my brother-in-law to come pick me up as he drives a bigger car."But even before they were on the road again their route home was flooded - and the traffic stalled as some motorists made u-turns while others attempted to pass but got stuck."I had mixed emotions as I was worried about our safety and others as well."People got out of their cars and walked away while some people helped others push their cars out of the water " Sefala said.She says she spent two hours stuck at one section of the road with other despairing drivers."We were helpless. We just prayed."They eventually managed to get home at 9pm."It was really bad. At one point my brother in-law said he saw a Hyundai Getz being swept away while a person was inside... this was when he was on his way to fetch me at the office."I am just happy to be alive."
