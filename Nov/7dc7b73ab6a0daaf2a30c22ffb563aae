"The LA Galaxy announced today that midfielder Steven Gerrard will not return to the club for the 2017 MLS season," read a statement issued by the Galaxy."Gerrard departs from LA following the conclusion of his contract in Major League Soccer at the end of the year."The 36-year-old had joined the Galaxy in July 2015 following his departure from Liverpool, where he starred for 17 years.Having previously been tipped to see out his playing days in the United States, he suggested that he will now move on to another club before hanging up his boots."When I left Liverpool, I came to Los Angeles with the goal of helping the Galaxy lift another MLS Cup," said Gerrard, who was eliminated in the Western Conference semi-finals with Galaxy by Colorado Rapids earlier this month."I am of course disappointed to have not achieved that objective, but I can look back at my time at the club with pride at what we accomplished, including two straight playoff appearances and countless memorable moments on the pitch."He added: "I am now looking forward to spending time with my family as I consider the next stage of my career."Gerrard scored five goals in 34 appearances for the Galaxy.His comments will be of interest to numerous potential suitors, including Scottish champions Celtic.Managed by Gerrard's former boss at Anfield Brendan Rodgers, they have been installed as the favourites with bookmakers to be his next port of call.Gerrard's departure comes a day after New York City F.C. confirmed his ex-England team-mate Frank Lampard, 38, will leave the club when his contract expires at the end of the year.Capped 114 times by England, Gerrard skippered home-town team Liverpool for 12 years, famously lifting the Champions League trophy in 2005 after an unforgettable comeback against AC Milan.He also won two FA Cups, three League Cups and the UEFA Cup at Liverpool, but he never laid his hands on the Premier League trophy.
