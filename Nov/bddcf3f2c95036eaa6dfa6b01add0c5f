But South Africa took three wickets for 10 runs in 29 deliveries with the new ball to curb the home side s advantage to 48 runs.At stumps on the second day Australia were 307/6 in reply to South Africa s first innings declaration at 259/9. Khawaja was 138 not out with Mitchell Starc on 16. He never looked flustered even when the ball beat his outside edge Peter Handscomb said of the centurion.As for Australia s handy position Handscomb said If we can stretch that lead to 150 in a perfect world that would be awesome. Australia resumed on 14 without loss and Kyle Abbott put a dent in that scoreline in the fourth over of the day when he had debutant Matt Renshaw well held low down by Dean Elgar diving to his right from third slip.Dangerman David Warner went six overs later for 11. He was also caught by Elgar but comfortably at chest height to earn Abbott s second wicket.That reduced Australia to 37/2 but it also put their most dependable pair Khawaja and Steve Smith at the crease.They batted together until the 10 over before dinner when Smith wanted a single to point but was refused the run by Khawaja.Smith tried to scramble back to the safety of the crease but was run out for 59 by Vernon Philander s throw to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock to end a partnership worth 137.Debutant Peter Handscomb joined Khawaja to share a stand of 99 that was snuffed out in the seventh over with the new ball with Abbott bowled Handscomb for 54 with an inswinger that snuck between bat and pad.Three overs later the third debutant in the Australian team Nic Maddinson was bowled for a duck by a half-volley from Kagiso Rabada.Six balls after that the home side were 283/6 when Vernon Philander had Matthew Wade caught behind with an away swinger.Abbott who moved the ball appreciably off the seam and under lights through the air took 3/38 from 25 overs 11 of them maidens.The match is South Africa s first pink-ball day/night test. - TMG Digital
