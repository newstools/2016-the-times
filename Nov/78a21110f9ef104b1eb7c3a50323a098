Castro died Friday aged 90 after defying the United States during a half-century of iron-fisted rule.During his campaign, Trump threatened if elected to reverse the historic rapprochement between the two countries realised under President Barack Obama."All of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them and that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands," he said in September."Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people and the freeing of political prisoners," he added.
