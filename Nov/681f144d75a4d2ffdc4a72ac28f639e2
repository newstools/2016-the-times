This is the comment of the Democratic Alliance following the release of the interim report by President Jacob Zuma on Wednesday afternoon.The DA spokeswoman on education Belinda Bozzoli said the report of the Commission into the feasibility of fee-free Higher Education and Training contained no evidence of experts consulted in drawing up the report. The report essentially says that there is no money and lots of work needed. This we already know. She said the report which the government claimed would provide much needed direction on the current crisis lacked any firm commitments and leadership. The future of millions of young people hangs in the balance in the absence of viable long-term solutions to the fee crisis and this report does not provide any answers to the students lecturers and the many more young people wishing to enter Higher Education. In the interim report the commission said there was little to be achieved by making access to higher education more readily accessible unless systemic and other deficiencies in the basic education system are simultaneously addressed. This also applies to the universities in relation to tightening the entrance criteria reducing the staff: student ratios and providing greater subsidies for the improvement of infrastructure to accommodate the larger student population that may be generated by free access the commission said in its interim report signed on November 2.
