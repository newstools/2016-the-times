SuperSport just a point behind early league leaders Bidvest Wits will be without two fullbacks and influential midfielder Dean Furman for the game because of suspension as they continue to aim for the top of the table. Onismor Bhasera and Michael Boxall also sit out the game leaving coach Stuart Baxter with a selection dilemma. Furman s suspension after an accumulation of cards comes at a fortuitous time as he would likely have had to miss the game anyway because of the rib injury that forced him to withdraw from the national team squad last week ahead of the World Cup qualifier against Senegal. Boxall also has one-match ban after collecting his fourth yellow of the season in the Telkom Knockout Cup quarterfinal penalties success over Mamelodi Sundowns. He too would have been likely to be left out of the trip to Polokwane because the right-back is only due back from World Cup duty on Thursday. Boxall played on Tuesday for New Zealand in New Caledonia in a World Cup draw and has had to make a long and fatiguing trip back. Bhasera misses both the match against Baroka who SuperSport beat in last season s Nedbank Cup semifinal as well as next Wednesday s clash with his old club Kaizer Chiefs after being sent off in SuperSport s last encounter against Sundowns. - TMG Sport
