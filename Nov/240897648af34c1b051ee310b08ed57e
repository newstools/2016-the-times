The ANC veterans, including stalwarts such as Rivonia triallists Ahmed Kathrada and Andrew Mlangeni, and Frank Chikane, Frene Ginwala and Murphy Morobe, said on Thursday they had sought a meeting with Zuma since September without success.They called on ANC leadership to openly voice their unhappiness about the state of the party.They want Zuma to resign and the ANC to hold a special congress to elect new leadership.It emerged on Thursday that the veterans had the support of former president Thabo Mbeki, who wrote a letter to Zuma on Tuesday requesting him to give the veterans an audience.But Maphatsoe has dismissed the "so-called veterans", saying they were attacking Zuma."Some of those veterans don't have good struggle credentials. Those who have good struggle credentials are sitting in the processes of the ANC," he said."They are empty tins making noise there," Maphatsoe said, calling the veterans irrelevant.In his letter, Mbeki warns Zuma that it would be against the traditions of the ANC to ignore the veterans, as the party's leadership had a long history of engaging dissatisfied members in the interest of resolving its political problems."Like you, I have been struck by the reality that this collective of 101 veterans represents a very senior, outstanding and historic echelon of the leadership of the ANC and the national democratic revolution . "It is made up of cadres of the ANC . whose involvement in our all-round struggle spans a period of over 60 years," Mbeki wrote."The point I am trying to emphasise is that it is imperative that all of us, including the current ANC NEC, must understand that the 101 veterans are in fact eminent leaders of our movement and revolution and have to be respected and treated as such by those who occupy administrative positions as members of the NEC and other senior structures of the ANC," said Mbeki."To put this matter frankly, which I know you will understand, it is perfectly obvious that very many among the 101 veterans are in fact eminently politically very senior to many who currently serve as members of the ANC NEC," Mbeki wrote.Mbeki's spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga, confirmed the letter but declined to comment further.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, who was copied in on the letter, refused to comment."The letter is written to President Zuma. Why don't you direct your inquiry to the office where the letter is directed to," said Mantashe. - Additional reporting Olebogeng Molatlhwa
