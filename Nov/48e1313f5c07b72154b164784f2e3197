Luthando Siyoni who initially confessed to helping Christopher Panayiotou orchestrate the murder of his wife Jayde told a stunned court the state had gone to extraordinary lengths to get him to say exactly what they wanted to hear.But Siyoni stuck to his guns about one thing he claimed Panayiotou 30 had given him R80 000 to pay Sizwezakhe Vumazonke 36 for the hit.While he now denies helping Panayiotou to find hitmen in April last year Siyoni said he had become aware of the plot to kill Jayde 29 only after her death.Taking the stand for the sixth day on Friday Siyoni went from refusing to answer questions from state advocate Marius Stander to telling Panayiotou s lawyers just what they needed to build their defence.Questioned by advocate Terry Price SC Siyoni said that before taking the stand for the first time on Friday last week he had told Stander and his attorney Zolile Ngqeza he would deviate from his statement and tell the court that police had assaulted him.He said Stander and investigating officer Captain Kanna Swanepoel had been aware of his plans to tell the truth as far back as September a month before the trial kicked off.A date was even set down in the High Court for Siyoni s Section 204 status to be revoked but Ngqeza came to some sort of agreement with the state.Towards the end of September a meeting was held between Siyoni Stander Ngqeza and Siyoni s mother and cousin. I was told if I don t stick to my statement I will stand trial as an accused. My mother and cousin left the meeting crying. Siyoni said his family had been told that should he not testify as a Section 204 witness he would face life in prison. My mom begged me to testify for the state but I said I am not prepared to lie. Siyoni also claimed the underhanded tactics from the police had started while he was being held in protective custody at the Humewood police station.At Panayiotou s bail application Swanepoel made a statement on Siyoni s behalf claiming the injuries he sustained were the result of a scuffle with police when he resisted arrest. Siyoni also alleged that he was never warned of his rights or given access to medical treatment after the assault.He further alleged that: A Legal Aid SA advocate was appointed to represent him despite him asking for a private attorney; For nearly two days in custody he was not given any food or water and did not sleep; During the assault police ripped his pants to look at his buttocks; and Swanepoel told him he needed to be in protective custody because Panayiotou wanted to kill him.Price said the police were cold-hearted enough to get Siyoni to phone Panayiotou to try to entrap him an hour after he buried his wife.TMG Digital
