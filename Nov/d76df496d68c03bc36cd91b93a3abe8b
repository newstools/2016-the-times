Last month in an exclusive interview with Times Media Digital Vermeulen expressed his frustration at the state of South African rugby in the aftermath of a record 57-15 defeat against the All Blacks in Durban.He told Times Media Digital at the time: It all starts at the top. And that is chaos at the moment. By the top I also mean the Sports Ministry. The sports minister has to help SA Rugby work towards and better plan for the future of the Boks. We always hear the minister is there to support us but I want to see him as part of the solution. This won t be an easy task and some people might deviate from the blueprint but those that stay and see it through might be able to turn the ship around. On Thursday Britain s Telegraph newspaper published another interview with Vermeulen in which he stood by his original comments and more.The 37-cap veteran who was overlooked for the current tour to Britain and Italy said he wants to be part of the solution but also wanted to see more leadership from the sport s hierarchy in SA."You always get ex-players talking about the game " Vermeulen told the Telegraph."You never hear current players say anything about the game but we are the guys who are really in there and see what is happening. Maybe I am the first active player to voice their opinion but that is a good thing."I just wanted to stand up for the players. Other people feel they cannot say anything. If that hinders my opportunity to be selected then so be it. I stand by what I said. It is just giving people the facts of what is going on."The most important thing is that people should pull in the same direction " he added."At the moment it is just chaos. Everyone has their own agendas. That's my opinion. That's how I felt within the set-up."He said he still hopes to be part of the Boks plans in the future. - TMG Digital
