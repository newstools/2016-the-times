Nyan'Nyan is a reality series that helps couples deal with their relationship problems. While the show employs relationship experts to help troubled couples, Luyanda also shares his thoughts and offers recommendations to help mend rocky relationships.However, this does not sit well with some fans of the show, who believe that Luyanda is not qualified to give relationship advice.Speaking to Move!, the TV presenter hit back at the critics, saying that he does not "need a degree to know what happens in relationships"."People ask where I get off advising people when I'm not a counsellor," he told the local publication."The advice I give is from experience, because I don't need a degree to know what happens in relationships, because I have been through it myself. My advice is not prescriptive, because I am not a professional."Luyanda has had his own fair share of relationship drama in the past.According to a Sunday World report from last year, Luyanda confessed to cheating on his then fianc e."I've been protecting my church like most people do, but now I can't live with a lie that I have cheated on Busi," he was quoted as saying by the local publication."Sometimes I hate myself for telling couples on TV how to stay faithful, while I'm known as a cheat and a liar."
