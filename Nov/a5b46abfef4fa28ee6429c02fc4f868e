The news comes just hours after Kanye shocked fans with a onstage outburst against former friends Jay Z and Beyonce, and subsequently canned his Saint Pablo Tour.The tour was reportedly set to run up until December 31, but all shows have officially been cancelled.According to international gossip site TMZ, Kanye was apparently being treated at a Los Angeles clinic, and was undergoing psychiatric tests, after being examined for exhaustion.While many took to Twitter to make fun of Kanye's condition in addition to accusing him of a publicity stunt, Nomzamo expressed her concern for the rapper and defended him against detractors."Making fun of people who suffer from mental illness is quite sad. It doesn't only come from a place of ignorance, but also bullying," she wrote, before pointing out that Kanye has "never been the same" since the passing of his mom in 2007."He's never been the same since her passing. That's what death does to you. You never stop the grieving."Other fans also extended their compassion for the Famous hitmaker.Really hope Kanye is okay, I remember seeing him in 07 a few weeks after his mum passed. Broke down during Hey Mama, tough time of year.I hope Kanye is okThe easy thing to do is make Kanye West jokes. The compassionate thing to do is hope he's ok and gets the help he needs.My heart goes out to Kanye, man. Keeping it together is tiring, I hope he can rest for awhile.Hope Kanye gets the help he needs. Mental health amongst men must be discussed more and not ridiculed. #kanyewestIf you like Kanye or Hate Kanye, what's maybe going on is no joking matter. Mental illness is not a joke and is a horrible place #KanyeWest
