He looked on course for a four-under 68 but he dropped a shot in a round that was a bit of a mixed bag.His round was a bit like the unpredictable wind containing two eagles three birdies two bogeys and a double bogey. It is a little windy " Coetzee said."It makes Augusta look like a playground the way the wind swirls around the koppies. It is quite tough out there. You don't know whether it is down or helping across or from which side it comes."The problem is it seems to be across on most of the holes but you don't know whether it is hurting or helping. You have to hit really good tee shots and judge the wind well and you have to have a bit of luck like I had on the 10th when I hit a four-iron strong and down the left."It hit the stand and bounced back to within 15 foot (4.5m). You need a bit of luck but maybe I can use my chances a bit better tomorrow. Eagles at the second and the 14th gave him a fighting chance of scoring a really low round. I hit two-iron on two to about three four foot (1.2m). I hit two-iron on 14 to about seven eight feet (2.4m). It is nice to make two eagles in the round. All in all I'm quite happy with the score but there are a few things I have to sort out on the range this afternoon. There is nothing to make a scene about."Maybe just swing a little better chip a little better putt a little better and hopefully score a little better. Last week I played really well and hit every shot how I wanted."One bad hole doesn't really affect your game so there's no need to throw the baby out with the bath water."Today was a little loose but I'm quite happy with the score. By the time he signed his card Chile's Felipe Aguilar had grabbed the clubhouse lead on four-under.South Korea's Jeunghun Wang and England's Ross Fisher also made it to four-under with the finish in sight. - TMG Digital
