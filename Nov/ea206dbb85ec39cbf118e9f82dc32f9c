Pirates have not won a Premier League game since their 2-1 victory away at winless Ajax Cape Town on September 13 and will have their hands full against a Stars team also still searching for its first taste of league victory.Even worse for Pirates the last time they won a home match in the league was on the opening day of the season when they came back from a goal down to beat Golden Arrows 3-1 on August 24.Bucs then won their second league match in succession away at Ajax Cape Town to take an early lead on the log standings.Since then the Buccaneers have gone off the rails as they slumped to four successive home draws before they were humiliated 6-1 by a rampant SuperSport United in their last match three weeks ago in Nelspruit.Pirates go into the weekend in sixth place on 10 points and cannot move into the top five until the following week at the earliest depending on results.Bucs have regular left-back Thabo Matlaba available for selection after he was released from the Bafana Bafana team who drew 1-1 away in Mozambique in Tuesday s international friendly.Matlaba returned with an injury that was never specified by either the club or the national team having played the 90 minutes of Bafana s 2-1 World Cup qualifying victory against Senegal in Polokwane on Saturday.Pirates bounced back to winning ways in Palacios s first match with a 2-1 Telkom Knockout quarterfinal win over visiting Highlands Park in their last match before the Fifa break.Stars too though come into this match high on confidence after they dumped Chiefs out of the same Telkom with a penalties victory in Durban two weeks ago.Stars have improved since the return of Italian Giovanni Solinas as head coach. They have reached the TKO semifinals by beating PSL league leaders Bidvest Wits and Chiefs.Pirates have won 15 of their 27 home matches against Stars suffering just two defeats.Stars who are winless in the League but unbeaten in their five matches in all competitions have no injury or suspension worries ahead of this match barring captain Paulus Masehe. The veteran defensive midfielder or centreback was ruled out for the rest of 2016 after suffering a serious injury in the Telkom win over Chiefs. One thing I can tell you is that the spirit in the team is high ahead of the Pirates clash. Preparations have gone smoothly and the mood is strong said Stars team manager Motuba Mokoena on Friday. It s a double motivation for the boys. We knocked Chiefs out of the cup and the boys will need very little motivation also against Pirates so the team is ready for battle. Stars are placed 14th with five points from eight matches. They are only two points ahead of 16th-placed Ajax.
