Thiem lost his opening group- stage match to Novak Djokovic, but the Tour Finals debutant could still make the last four after seeing off flamboyant Frenchman Monfils at London's O2 Arena.The 23-year-old will need to beat Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic in his last group match tomorrow to reach the semifinals.Monfils is certain to be eliminated after losing his first two matches."It was a very close match but luckily he helped me in the last game. Maybe I was the lucky one today," Thiem said. "I am very happy there's still a chance for me to reach the semifinals, but Milos Raonic is an amazing opponent."I can't wait to get back out here in this amazing arena." Thiem is regarded as an emerging star after a breakthrough season and the Austrian had shown no signs of being intimidated by the Tour Finals stage when he took a set off defending champion Djokovic.Thiem should garner plenty more backers if he continues to develop at his current rapid pace.Thiem was too powerful for the error-prone Monfils in the first set, securing the only break in the sixth game and using his thudding serve to stay ahead.But, after seeming to be hampered by injury in the first set, Monfils suddenly found his rhythm in a one-sided second set, as Thiem lost his way.Thiem folded against Djokovic, but he was far more focused in the final set against Monfils and clinched the win with a break in the ninth game after a string of double faults from the Frenchman.
