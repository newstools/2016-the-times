The Boks limped into Cardiff On Sunday after a humiliating 20-18 loss to Italy and at the tail end of the worst season in history.If they lose on Saturday it would be the first time ever that the Boks have lost eight Tests in a calendar year. Strauss the embattled captain will play his final Test at the Principality Stadium this weekend but he was adamant that his personal feelings were secondary to the needs of the team and the desire to win again.With no more to lose after seven losses in 11 Tests the Boks are going to have to be courageous and committed in one final push before drawing a line under a season of despair.In the next few days Strauss drawing on the experience of being part of the Bok team that lost to Japan at last year s World Cup believes that clear leadership is needed in this time of crisis. The one thing I learned after we lost to Japan last year is that you can't have too many voices after a performance and defeat like that Strauss said. You have to have a clear vision one direct way of doing things clear calls being made and everyone has to buy into that to the letter. Everyone is hurting we are all desperate for a win and to play a good game of rugby."So everyone is willing to buy into the coach s direction and the vision he gives us for the week. We have a few days to sit as a team and discuss not only on field tactics but also mental preparation for the week. After the shock loss to the Azzurri in Florence it was veteran wing Bryan Habana who had played his 124th Test that spoke to the team in the huddle in the middle of the Artemio Franchi Stadium.Strauss revealed that the elder statesman of the group asked the players to dig deep and rally this week. Bryan has been through many highs and many lows and he reassured us that we need more than ever to stick together as a team Strauss said He also reiterated that we have to fight back because as South Africans we never lie down."We immediately knew how serious the impact of that loss was compared to losing any other time. It was a significant moment and Bryan urged us to fight back. The Boks had no on-field training on Monday as torrential rain swept through Cardiff.Coetzee opted to give the players a lighter schedule although there were still one-on-ones between players and coaches and split planning sessions for the forwards and backs.- TMG Digital
