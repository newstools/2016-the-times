SA Breweries urged parents yesterday to pay attention to signs of stress, anxiety and depression in teenagers during exams as part of its campaign to address teen drinking.The government recently proposed increasing the minimum drinking age from 18 to 21 to stem alcohol abuse.It has now extended the period for public comment to Monday.Experts said the proposal would have little or no effect on alcohol abuse or underage drinking.The 2012 Unisa Youth Research Unit Substance Abuse Survey showed that about 15% of boys and 8% of girls had their first drink before the age of 13.In Gauteng 86% of teenagers as young as 14 consumed alcohol on a regular basis."The Unisa research shows that 49% of teenagers in the average South African home have at some stage experimented with alcohol."Yet other research we have done shows that the vast majority of parents believe their kids do not drink," said SAB alcohol policy manager Rowan Dunne.SAB said: "Teenagers sometimes feel overwhelmed by life and may then turn to alcohol for solace if they do not have a healthy outlet for frustration."Alcohol is a very powerful anxiolytic drug that reduces symptoms of stress and anxiety."After initial exposure to alcohol teenagers start to believe it can ward off their painful feelings."If their lives are not going well, they figure they have nothing to lose by using alcohol," SAB said.Durban anti-drug and alcohol campaigner Sam Pillay said stressed pupils usually turned to calming medication, which could be addictive, during examinations."Girls and boys experiment with alcohol after examinations."It is more prominent at house parties when parents are at work during the holidays. That is where most of the underage drinking takes place," he said.Pillay said the National Liquor Amendment Bill's proposal to raise the minimum drinking age to 21 years was impractical."Changing laws is to show the public that something is being done but on ground level nothing would change," he said.
