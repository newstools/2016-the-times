Wisani has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Nosipho Mandleleni 24.Advancing his defence on Friday during closing arguments Wisani asked the court to acquit him because the versions given by state witnesses were a "fabrication"."Based on circumstantial evidence I submit that the state's evidence is purely speculation said Wisani.He also argued that there were gaps in the state's case: "The state should have conducted a fingerprint report on the sjambok and sneakers to determine the real perpetrator."They should have produced copies of the entire transcript of the previous trial."The state should have taken the blood alcohol level of the deceased and should have called the other people who were in the house [where the murder took place]."Wisani also accused a police officer who was the murder scene of fabricating her evidence. "Captain Qilingana fabricated the theory that the accused ran away in full view of law enforcement officers."The court reserved judgment to November 21.It is the state's case that on September 5 2015 Wisani whipped Mandleleni to death with a sjambok and a broom stick in the room they shared in Yeoville Johannesburg. Mandleleni died from excessive loss of blood and blunt force trauma.Wisani's R3,000 bail was later revoked after he allegedly assaulted Mandleleni's twin sister Siphokazi and her friend Zimbini Mathibe outside a club in Johannesburg on May 22 this year.He allegedly threatened Siphokazi and told her not to testify against him.
