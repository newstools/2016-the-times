It also called on the university and the Wits Student Representative Council to condemn this blatant anti-Semitism in the strongest possible terms .It posted photos of the graffiti on its Facebook page - one said Kill a Jew while the other said F*** the Jews . SAUJS maintains that every student on campus should be free from intimidation regardless of their race religion gender or self-identification. Jewish students are no exception the SAUJS said. SAUJS Countrywide is aware of another instance of anti-Semitic graffiti at Wits, this time containing a clear incitement... There can be no justification for such hateful ignorant and offensive acts. Today, we have seen anti-Semitic graffiti painted in a building at Wits University. Only 2 weeks have passed since one... The group said it is in contact with the office of the Dean of Students to ensure that the graffiti be removed and to find those responsible .Last year the SAUJS became embroiled in a war of words with then SRC president Mcebo Dlamini who caused an uproar when he posted on Facebook: I love Adolf Hitler. SAUJS told student newspaper Vuvuzela that Dlamini was a racist and a total embarrassment and disgrace to Wits University. Dlamini is currently in prison after being denied bail. He was arrested for charges relating to #FeesMustFall protests.
