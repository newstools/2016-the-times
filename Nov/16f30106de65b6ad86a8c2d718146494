City share the leadership of the league with Bidvest Wits and are now off to a cup final in a spectacular opening five months of business since John Comitis bought the franchise of Mpumalanga Black Aces and create a new club in the Mother City.It was a seventh win in a row for the side coached by Eric Tinkler who totally dominated a Stars side who haven t won in the league yet and can now concentrate on getting themselves off the foot of the league table.A combination of wastefulness in front of goal and stellar goalkeeping by Thela Ngobeni kept City s lead to just a single goal at half-time but the final score better reflected their superiority.At times City were carving up the Stars defence with a power display of pace on the attack and they should have had the outcome secured inside the first 45 minutes.They took the lead from a 10th minute penalty after a wild tackle by Stars captain Katlego Mashego inside his own box on Aubrey Ngoma that left no doubt in the referee s, and spectators, mind.Manyama tucked it away for the lead and then City got going with their attack, spurred by the masterful passing and cerebral ability of Manyama who conducted matters like an orchestra boss.But Ngobeni denied Sibusiso Masina and Ngoma in quick succession and then made another brilliant save to deny Masina again.Ngoma also squandered with some poor shooting as did Thamsanqa Mkhize from close range.But it was no surprise when City went 2-0 up after another defensive howler. Davis Nkausu played a clearance out of central defence straight at Manyama who set up Roland Putsche with a back heel. The Austria had enough time to change the ball onto his right and frill it low and hard, beating Ngobeni off the post.In total City had 14 shots at goal in the first half, nine of them on target.But instead of wrapping up the result early, Masina gave away a free kick on the edge of the City box in the 38th minute and Thokozani Sekotlong curled a stunning free kick over the wall to pull a goal back.A similar free kick just after the hour mark saw City restore their two goal advantage. Sifiso Mbhele s clumsy tackle on Manyama gave away a set piece that Ngobeni did well to tip over the top. But Manyama took the resultant corner as well and found Mpho Matsi at the back post to make it 3-1.The talismanic Manyama went off soon after with an ankle injury that put a damper on the home s side victory.His replacement Judas Moseamedi set up Ngoma for the fourth with the nippy left winger banging the ball home with his right 10 minutes from the end.Stars ignominious day ended with a red card for Angelo Kerspuy for lashing out in a challenge with Putsche just before the final whistle. - TMG Digital
