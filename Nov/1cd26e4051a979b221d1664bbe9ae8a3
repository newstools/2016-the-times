Juan Pedro, who is billed in Mexico as the world's fattest man, said that until this week he had been living at home with his mother with no medical care and insufficient resources to buy the right kind of food and medicines to keep his weight down."I did not know what was happening to me," Pedro, of Aguascalientes, said."My body just followed its own path without any control whatsoever. I tried to diet day after day, but nothing worked and I became desperate. Finally, my body suffered a bad reaction and I was in a coma for a while, waking up in bed from where I haven't moved since."Doctors say Pedro has type 2 diabetes, thyroid problems, hypertension and liquid in his lungs."His hypothyroidism has done terrible damage to his organism, slowing processes down and causing his body to store rather than burn off what he ingests," explained Dr Jos Casta eda, the director of the Gastric Bypass Mexico hospital in Guadalajara."He is probably only still alive due to his youth," added the doctor, who estimated that Pedro would need at least six months of treatment to stabilise his body before gastric bypass surgery could be undertaken."It's impossible for the human body to cope with the pathologies Juan Pedro suffers from over a prolonged period, but I think we are just in time," Casta eda said."This is no life; the worst sentence you can give a human being is to make a prison of his own body," said Pedro.According to his mother, Pedro was overweight but active as a boy, playing the guitar, singing in a choir and kicking a football around."He was a good cumbia dancer and had two or three girlfriends," Mar a de Jes s Salas told the newspaper El Universal.Pedro's mother said his health and obesity worsened after he had a road accident at the age of 17.
