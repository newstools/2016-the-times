Three of the five candidates interviewed by Parliament s Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence work at the office of the inspector general and sit on the executive committee.Their interviews revealed that while the organisation was limping along administratively it faced court actions and had been barred from conducting any oversight of the intelligence work of certain intelligence services. It is also unable to fill any vacant posts.The post has been open for 20 months as opposition parties moved to block the appointment of ANC favourite Cecil Burgess. The successful candidate needs to be confirmed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament.Jay Govender who has worked in the office for the past 12 years as legal advisor to the IGI told the committee in response to a question by the UDM's Bantu Holomisa that the office was "clearly not without its problems" but said "in every organisation there may be problems some of which might be construed as bigger than others".She said the complaints function was "operational to a certain extent" and said she had been able to approve expenditure up to a certain level.But she said there were matters where the executive committee's "hands are tied" including threats of court action with regards to certain reports. She said the office also faced legal action in terms of non-compliance with the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA).Mampogoane Nchabeleng who also sits on the executive committee said that they had been "managing the office as a collective" since the departure of the previous IGI."We continued to make decisions as far as we could" he said.But he said certain services had blocked their work saying they could not conduct oversight without an inspector general at the helm.He said that while he had confidence in the country's intelligence services which were "ready to deliver what needs to be delivered" he could not say what they had been doing in the past year. "I can t say they have done this or that because we have been prevented from gaining access to one service in particular".Smanga Jele who also works in the office said it was being run by "collective leadership".All three candidates received a grilling about the processes the exco followed in conducting meetings and taking decisions as well as the paper trail involved in delegating tasks to senior management at a time when an Inspector General was appointed but was not at work.Murray Hunter spokesman for the Right2Know campaign which has been campaigning to have the post filled said: "It's strange that the committee grilled these candidates since it was this committee's job to put an Inspector General in place. We have seen serious troubles at the watchdog during this time and Parliament must accept the responsibility. It is unfair for Parliament to shift the blame to the few staffers who have tried to keep the watchdog functioning."Without an Inspector General there was nobody to legally sign off on investigations or release documents to the public. In other words for more than a year there has been nobody to keep the spooks in check but staff have done their best to keep things running " he said.The day's first candidate Stellenbosch professor Bruce Watson meanwhile spent most of his interview explaining his complex citizenship. Born in Zimbabwe to South African parents he was registered as a South African. His parents later moved to Canada where he gained citizenship and he told the committee that he also held citizenship in the Netherlands.Quizzed about his three passports he said he used his South African one mostly but used the other two to avoid costly visas and to make travelling easier allowing him to skip immigration queues in Europe and the fingerprinting process in the United States.The remaining five candidates will be interviewed on Wednesday. - TMG Digital/The Times
