His office said on Tuesday that the account was under Nhleko s full names Nkosinathi Nhleko and even featured the minister s individual pictures and those taken with members of the Saps. I wish to categorically distance myself from the Facebook account and regard the fraudulent use of my name and pictures as a serious violation of my individual rights. This act must be condemned in the strongest terms possible. For the record I have never been on social media and have no intention to do so in the near future the minister said.Nhleko charged that he did not take the matter lightly just because the fraudulent act was on social media.He said this should sensitise all South Africans to the dark world of internet fraud and cyber crime. The act is utterly disgusting and devilish. Plato summed it pretty well: 'false words are not only evil in themselves but they infect the soul with evil' Nhleko said.His spokesperson Sandile Ngidi said the minister was considering appropriate legal action and encouraged all South Africans to periodically check if they too may be victims of social network fraud and other cyber crimes.Ngidi said at its 85th Interpol General Assembly in Indonesia last week which Nhleko attended the world policing body had noted that criminals had intensified their abuse of social media.He said Interpol had warned of "an escalating use of the internet and social media to conduct crimes ranging from illicit trade to child sexual abuse .- TMG Digital/The Times
