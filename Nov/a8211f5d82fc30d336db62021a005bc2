Party spokesman Zizi Kodwa was speaking after the state of capture report was released by the public protector on Wednesday following an order to do so by the North Gauteng High Court.The report titled 'State of Capture' suggested that Zuma acted unethically in handling matters relating to alleged state capture by the Gupta family.Kodwa however said the report does not recommend that the party remove its president."We have full confidence in the president. There is nowhere in the report in the remedial action where it suggests that the ANC must not have confidence in the president we must deal with factual issues in the report " Kodwa added.He said the ANC would study the report carefully before coming to a conclusion. - TMG Digital
