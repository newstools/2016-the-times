The series of tremors, all followed by powerful aftershocks, proved the final straw for a number of important architectural landmarks, including the Abbey of Sant-Eutizio in Umbria, and damaged several churches and buildings in Rome, including the Colosseum.Scientists have said that the Eternal City is constantly under threat from a different source - one right on its doorstep. Although classified as dormant, the nearby volcano is showing signs of activity which, combined with the seismic history of the area, would indicate it is slowly reactivating, an international team of scientists said.While in geological times the eruption would be imminent, it is probably far off on a human scale - about 1000 years - and there isn't currently any cause for worry.Chambers located between 5km and 10km under the residential areas of Ariccia, Castel Gandolfo, Albano and other "Roman castles" are filling up with magma and the ground is rising at a rate of 2-3mm a year, the scientists said. The team, from the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology, La Sapienza University, reconstructed the history of the 600,000 years of the Alban Hills, 20km southeast of Rome, and have calculated the cyclicality of the eruptions.Scientists say the long pauses between activity are the main cause for worry."When the eruption happens, it has an explosive effect, like opening a champagne bottle after shaking it," said researcher Fabrizio Marra. "This sort of process has, for example, caused the string of earthquakes that hit this area at the beginning of the '90s, with minor quakes and a few cases of magnitude-four quakes."As far as earthquakes are concerned, politicians should pay more attention than scientists: we know the type of seismic activity; in a normal country the area would have already been secured. In the castles, like in the rest of the country, it is necessary to verify that buildings are safe. The good news is that, after the string of quakes in the '90s, nothing collapsed."The earthquakes that have hit central Italy and keep on shaking the Apennines should not affect the volcanic activity of the Albans, according to Marra. "It's out of the question that they [the recent earthquakes] could have significant effects, at least for now. Maybe in 1000 years they will," he said."A seismic event could trigger a volcanic eruption, like in the US with St Helens. But it can only happen with a volcano on the verge of erupting; at these levels there is no possible disturbance that could reach the magma chambers."Italy's most powerful earthquake in 36 years has left more than 15,000 people homeless, as the scale of the damage done to irreplaceable historic buildings became apparent.Although Sunday's 6.6-magnitude tremor did not result in any deaths, the third powerful quake since August 24, when nearly 300 people died in a 6.2 magnitude quake, has left thousands of homes in ruins or structurally unsafe and emptied a string of villages and small towns across the country's mountainous central regions.
