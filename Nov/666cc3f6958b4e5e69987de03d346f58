Fransman was due to face the music for allegedly sexually harassing former employee Louisa Wynand, when they travelled to the ANC's birthday bash in North West in January.Fransman sent his lawyer to the hearing that is set to continue today.The party's integrity committee launched an investigation after Wynand reported the matter to police. It then recommended action against Fransman.In addition to facing a charge of sexual misconduct, he has been charged for taking the party to court to obtain a copy of the committee's recommendations.The hearing, which was chaired by Minister of Women in the Presidency Susan Shabangu, was held behind closed doors at the Good Hope Building in parliament.The Times understands that Wynand and her mother testified yesterday.Leading the ANC's case was Uriel Abrahamse, who successfully prosecuted EFF leader Julius Malema, and who was ANCYL president at the time.In a statement yesterday, Fransman said among the reasons for not attending was ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe's failure to make good on promises to supply documents related to the hearing."I refuse to be part of a faction at Luthuli House's war of the jungle, where there's disrespect for organisational protocols and where those who are giving support to this faction are supported irrespective of their wrongdoings," he said.Mantashe declined to comment, except to add: "I don't want to be part of this and I didn't speak with Marius."ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa could not be reached for comment.Meanwhile, DA Western Cape chief whip Mike Wiley alleged Fransman owes the provincial legislature R670000 in legal fees.Fransman went to court to try to stop the legislature from probing contracts worth billions of rand that he approved.
