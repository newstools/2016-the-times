Educational psychologists, according to psychologist Susan Kriegler, took the health minister to court arguing that the current regulations seriously limited what they were able to do in practice and had forced them into the role of special needs teachers and not psychologists.In 2011 the health minister and Health Professions Council of SA drew up regulations explaining what each type of psychologist - including industrial, educational, forensic and clinical psychologists - could and couldn't do.Clinical psychologists were allowed to treat depression, stress and mental illness, but educational psychologists could not do so.Educational psychologists argued that the scope of practice in the regulations was narrow and did not allow them to act as psychologists.In what has been described as a turf war between shrinks, clinical psychologists, who joined the court battle, argued that the regulations as they stood were correct.The matter was settled out of court on Monday.The minister conceded the consultation process used to draw up the new regulations was not adequate or sufficiently consultative.The health minister has two years to fix the law and seek proper consultation.In the interim, the old regulations remain in place.
