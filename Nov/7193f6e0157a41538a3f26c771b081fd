The visitors reached tea on 295/3 in their second innings for a lead of 293.Elgar was 112 not out with Duminy dismissed for 141 with what became the last ball before the interval.That ended a stand worth 250 that started more than an hour before stumps on Friday.Duminy leapt towards his hundred by hitting five fours through the off side from the first 10 balls he faced after lunch.He reached his fifth century - and his third against Australia - with a drive through the covers off Mitchell Marsh for two in the eighth over of the second session.Duminy s effort broke a streak of 16 completed innings without a century that started in July 2014.He was caught behind driving expansively at a wide delivery from Peter Siddle having been at the crease for five-and-a-half hours faced 225 balls and hit 20 fours and a six.The less fluent Elgar faced 281 deliveries - more than in any of his other 40 test innings - and also scored his fifth century.Elgar was 81 not out when he skied a drive off off-spinner Nathan Lyon.Mitchell Starc running back from mid-on lost his balance and his bearings as he turned to take the catch and the ball fell to earth.Two deliveries later Elgar repeated the stroke and this time smashed a six.Lyon was on the receiving end again in the seventh over before tea when Elgar drove him through the covers for four to reach his century.Elgar s innings will give him a better memory of the WACA than he made on his debut there in November 2012 when he bagged a pair.Batting on a still sound surface neither Elgar nor Duminy seemed troubled by an Australian attack that struggled to bowl with penetration even after they took the new ball when it was due midway through the second session.South Africa will want to build an even bigger lead than usual what with Dale Steyn removed from their attack with a fractured shoulder.The mercury was forecast to climb to 37 degrees Celsius in Perth on Saturday which only added to the effort of bowling.South Africa made sure Australia got that message at the drinks breaks.Along with cooling refreshment the visitors support staff also brought two plastic chairs and an umbrella onto the field.The Australians looked on bemused as Elgar and Duminy sat in a pool of shade for a few minutes in each session.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
