Thanks to actor-director Jon Favreau, who made the recent Jungle Book movie, this is now an experience one can really (well, almost) have: a virtual reality experiment that hovers somewhere between a movie and a game.Gnomes &amp; Goblins combines the mechanics of traditional gaming with the cinematic style one finds in a movie.It was recently released for HTC Vive headsets and is set to be released for other products later this year.But, said Favreau at a recent innovation summit at the University of California, Los Angeles, virtual reality might be the next big thing , but strong storytelling was still the key ingredient.He said that Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg s 1993 blockbuster that combined real footage with computer-generated imagery, offered great hope as it was a successful experiment in special effects.After that, everyone went crazy for its formula and wanted to emulate how Spielberg had married all the different technologies together .But, said Favreau, it has to be paired up with brilliant storytelling it still has to be about the story and characters .He said: Storytelling is a human endeavour. Technology heightens it when done well, but otherwise distracts from it. If you can use technology to make people connect more, that is the point. It is like social media it can make you feel less connected because you see children looking into phones, but in that moment, they are connecting with others, he said.Gnomes &amp; Goblins, which relies on tracking eye contact, actually offers a very powerful connection and is more like a lucid dream than a game or movie , he said.
