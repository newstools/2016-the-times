South Africa, proportionately, pound-for-pound, produces the best jockeys in the world. It's a competitive advantage that, sadly, we can't translate into national economic gain.Way back in the 1960s some clever guys came up with the idea of the SA Jockey Academy, doing away with the dodgy indenture apprentice system and giving lads a better grounding in life, with full schooling and expert coaching in their chosen job.Over decades the academy has churned out a stream of world-class jockeys: Michael Roberts, Basil Marcus, Dougie Whyte, Piere Strydom, Anthony Delpech and Anton Marcus, to name a few.The academy concept has since been copied around the world.For the past few years it's been a treat to see our best home-based riders take on teams of top foreign hoops in the International Jockeys' Challenge. Usually the locals win.That's not to say the visitors are substandard. Indeed, some of the best in the world have graced this event over the years.The most famous jockey Frankie Dettori is back this weekend to captain the Internationals in the two-leg showdown - at Fairview in Port Elizabeth today and at Turffontein in Johannesburg on Sunday. Dettori has Europe's best female jockey Hayley Turner in his arsenal, along with Irishmen Pat Cosgrave and Fergus Sweeney, Scotsman Robert Havlin and Frenchman Aurelian Lemaitre.It's a pity there are no Aussies coming. They're so easy to klap.S'manga Khumalo is captain of the local heroes: Anthony Delpech, Grant van Niekerk, Aldo Domeyer, Gavin Lerena and Muzi Yeni.I must declare a personal interest in S'manga winning one particular race, the sixth at Turfies - on my pride and joy Duzi Moon. Other than that, I'll be shouting for Frankie, who has some good mounts.The contest will be over four races at each of the two venues, with a draw for rides and points allocated for finishing positions - from 30 for a win down to zip for 12th place. The tote offers an array of bets on individual winners and placed riders on each day - win, place, swinger, exacta, trifecta and quartet.Sandwiched between the two jockey battles is a meeting at Kenilworth featuring the most important races of the weekend, the Grade 2 Selangor Cup and the Ready To Run Stakes.The latter carries an absurd purse for a non-graded event - R2.5-million - thanks to subscriptions chipped in for the "sales race".The exclusive nature of the affair means the quality of the 16-strong field is a bit patchy, but the top six or seven runners in the betting still present a competitive affair.Always In Charge is likely to start as favourite and might have been contesting the more prestigious Selangor Cup half-an-hour later but for the disparity in the prize money.The Selangor offers a measly R400 000, but a sparkling collection of talented three-year-olds will be duelling for it over 1600m.Table Bay tops the boards after four wins in six starts to date, but the Australian import faces stiff competition from a fellow son of Redoute's Choice, Al Fahad, who is unbeaten after two outings.I have a feeling, though, that William Longsword will run them through.He has won three on the trot, with two course-and-distance victories and looks like a rapid improver.A bounty of brilliant action awaits.
