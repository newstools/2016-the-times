Both Sundowns and Chiefs coaches will be watching with interest nay trepidation the outcome of the match in Maputo and any possible ill effects on their respective players who are with the national team.Already Sundowns will likely have to play without Tebogo Langerman after he pulled a hamstring in training with the national team last week and Itumeleng Khune looked to hurt himself in making some key saves in Saturday s World Cup qualifying win over Senegal in Polokwane.At the same time Sundowns will have the likes of Denis Onyango and Kennedy Mweene coming back from World Cup duty and Khama Billiat from Sunday s friendly in Harare where he was a second half substitute in Zimbabwe s 3-0 victory over Tanzania in a friendly international.Chiefs midfield mainstay Willard Katsande played the full 90 minutes in the game.Saturday s Premier Soccer League clash at Loftus Versfeld will be the biggest of the new local season so far trumping the Soweto derby at the end of last month.Sundowns will be playing only their their fourth league game of the season but can catapult from second last in the standings to 11th if they win.Chiefs sit just one point behind early season leaders Bidvest Wits.But after a draw with Baroka in their last league game and a defeat on post-match penalties at the hands of Free State Stars in the Telkom Knockout quarter-final there is again mounting pressure on coach Steve Komphela after a run of four successive wins in September and October. - TMG Digital
