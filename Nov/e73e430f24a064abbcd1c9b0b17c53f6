 So far we have discovered that the former mayor Ramokgopa enjoyed a R30-million-per-year discretionary slush fund to spend as he pleased on dispensing patronage and handouts as he saw fit " said DA leader Mmusi Maimane in a statement on Sunday.Maimane made the statement following the party s two-day federal council meeting in Johannesburg.Tshwane has been at the centre of investigations and allegations by the party stemming from irregular expenditure amounting to billions."The City of Tshwane government was technically bankrupt when we took over due to irresponsible spending and acts of nepotism by the previous ANC administration " he said.The DA is also looking into the failed R90-million city hall refurbishment project and the R12-million upgrade of the mayoral house for which Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga said the city had criminally charged implicated officials.The ANC said if the DA was sure of the allegations against Ramokgopa then the party was welcome to do something about it. If they are saying there s a slush fund they must lay criminal charges or institute a disciplinary hearing said ANC Tshwane spokesman Teboho Joala.He said the DA should focus on service delivery issues such as providing clean water and building roads for the people of Tshwane. That s frivolous [the allegations] you see. DA politics their approach in taking over as the governing party has been nothing but a series of allegations and no action he said.Ramokgopa could not immediately be reached for comment.
