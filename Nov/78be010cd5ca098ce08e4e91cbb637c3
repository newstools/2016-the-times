Yesterday the Gupta-owned channel announced that it was postponing the awards, which were to be held on November 25.Last week the EFF called on local celebrities to cancel their participation in the "criminal" event. It claimed the Gupta family was trying to "legitimise their criminal activities in South Africa" by hosting the awards."The Guptas have no moral ground to tell us who the South African of the Year is when they have clearly shown the disrespect and disdain they have for this our beloved country," the EFF said.Concert promoter Mike Fuller, of Famous Concerts, said: "Jennifer Lopez costs a lot of money. She is one of the top-earning female performers." He said normally if the organisers cancelled the event, they stood to lose their fees.
