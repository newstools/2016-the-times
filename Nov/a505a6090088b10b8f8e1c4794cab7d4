This follows a whirlwind of public reaction after Prophet Detective Lethebo Rabalago 24 shared pictures of himself spraying congregants with the multi-insect killer during a prayer meeting in Mookgophong on his Facebook page.On Tuesday morning Limpopo health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba said the department would approach the courts to get permission to have Rabalago taken in for psychiatric evaluation.Ramathuba said this was not intended to insult Rabalago but to ascertain whether or not his behaviour was influenced my mental illness.In a previous interview with the Sowetan Rabalago a leader of the Mount Zion General Assembly defended his practices. He explained that he received a revelation from God. He said people who came with illnesses including cancer and ulcers had been healed after he prayed over the Doom.Ramathuba however said the concern was that his actions were putting people in danger by exposing them to toxic substances.She said authorities might have to go to court to have Rabalago declared as an involuntary patient before he can be observed at one of the local mental health facilities. Ramathuba also called for those who had been sprayed with the product to avail themselves for medical check-ups adding that some side-effects may not be detected immediately upon contact. She warned that skin irritation tremors and other long-term conditions such as liver failure could occur if the people exposed do not seek immediate treatment.On Monday the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural Religious and Linguistic Communities released a statement condemning Rabalago s actions.Tiger Brands the company that manufactures Doom also called for Rabalago to refrain from using the product on people. - Sowetan
