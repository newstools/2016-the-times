It was the Boks' seventh loss in 11 Tests this year and also the first time Italy have beaten the Springboks in 13 attempts.The defeat comes in a season when the Boks lost at home to Ireland for the first time, away to Argentina for the first time and endured a record 57-15 home defeat against the All Blacks.After the match SA Rugby issued a hasty statement explaining a full review would take place after next week's Test against Wales.But that is standard procedure. It's almost unprecedented for SA Rugby to make such a statement and the fact that it didn't unequivocally back the coach and his staff, was telling.Coetzee, when asked directly if he would resign, was evasive."My future is out of my hands but this was definitely not Springbok standard," Coetzee said."This is the darkest and toughest moment of my coaching career. But I don't want to look at it emotionally now because emotions are high. I'm in a difficult position."I still think I'm the man that can turn it around and I don't believe I've lost the change-room."We have a plan and players bought into it. But somehow when the pressure was on and Italy stayed close and got belief, we [the players] went outside the plan again."Italy coach Conor O'Shea backed Coetzee to stay in the job."I feel massively for Allister because he is an incredible man and coach and I hope people in SA stick by him."- TMG Sport
