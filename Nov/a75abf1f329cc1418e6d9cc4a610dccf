But with all of their computing power and sheer convenience comes a caveat they spy on you.Just ask Eskom CEO Brian Molefe Des van Rooyen or Ajay Gupta.Their mobile phones provided potentially damning evidence to former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela as she compiled her report State of Capture.The technology used to keep mobile phones connected to calls and the internet as they move from place to place can be used to reveal the whereabouts of a person relationships between people and even allow investigators to travel back in time to listen to past conversations. How it works.Depending on which cellular network you use your phone is constantly connected to the service provider's GSM network.The network signals are transmitted to handsets via various cell phone towers across suburbs and cities around the country.In layman s terms the position of a mobile phone can be fairly accurately determined by gathering information exchanged between the device and two or more cell towers nearby.This method used legally by law enforcement agencies is non-intrusive and the target or person being monitored is not aware of the surveillance.A more accurate location-gathering tool is the installation of software on a mobile handset that uses GPS to determine the position of a person at any given time.Law enforcement agencies use tracking technology to find criminals and even missing people.Madonsela used a subpoena to obtain telephone records of some of those named in the state capture report. Using these records her team of investigators were able to confirm that Duduzane Zuma the son of President Jacob Zuma and Deputy Minister of Finance Mr Mcebisi Jonas had a meeting at the Hyatt Regency Hotel on October 23 2016 between 1pm and 2pm.The same analysis put various people implicated in the state capture report at a home in Saxonwold Johannesburg owned by the Gupta family.The information stored by the networks and on mobile phones also allowed Madonsela to map the relationship between Molefe and Ajay Gupta and how the close friends exchanged 58 telephone calls in eight months between 2015 and 2016.South African company VASTech SA is a global player in the development of sophisticated technology to - legally - spy on mobile phone calls and messages.Investigative publication The Intercept (https://theintercept.com/2016/10/31/south-african-spy-company-used-by-gadaffi-touts-its-nsa-like-capabilities/) reported on Monday that the company which previously sold equipment to Muammar Gaddafi s regime to monitor citizens via their phones - is now claiming that it can intercept communications on a scale that rivals a government spy agency.In a 2016 pamphlet produced by VASTech SA the company says it conduct passive detection of communications from satellites fixed and mobile phones and fibre optic cable.- TMG Digital
