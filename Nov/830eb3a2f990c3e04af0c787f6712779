Maqula 28 and fellow ANC councillor Andile Lungisa 39 who are facing charges of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm spent hours in the holding cells at the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court waiting for their names to be called.They had handed themselves over at the Humewood police station before 9am and were then arrested charged and taken to court in an unmarked police vehicle.Both were released on R1000 bail and will have to appear in court on January 17.Their bail conditions include avoiding similar assault incidents and not interfering with the investigation.The day was filled with suspense as there was a delay in delivering the police docket to the court prolonging the councillors time in the holding cells. They eventually appeared before magistrate Sanjani Naidoo shortly before 4pm.A large group of ANC members and councillors turned up at the court to support their comrades.Lungisa was identified by investigators through cellphone video footage as allegedly being the man who hit Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor Rano Kayser over the head with a glass water jug during the meeting on Thursday.Maqula is accused of stabbing DA chief whip Werner Senekal in the back during the council meeting.The Herald reported on Tuesday that Maqula was already serving a non-custodial sentence for kidnapping and beating an 18-year-old boy in Kwazakhele in 2014.Maqula was convicted in August last year and sentenced to three years under correctional supervision and 12 months imprisonment suspended for five years.Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said Maqula and two relatives beat the teenager whom they accused of burglary with spanners poured boiling water over him and threw knives and glass bottles at him.Department of Correctional Services spokesman Zama Feni confirmed that Maqula was still serving his sentence.
