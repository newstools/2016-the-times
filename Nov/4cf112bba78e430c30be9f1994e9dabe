Creecy wrote to fellow provincial cabinet members, whose departments were found to have spent portions of their budgets without following proper procedure, asking them to investigate the cause of such spending and take disciplinary action against guilty officials.Holding officials accountable for irregular expenditure has proved difficult because departments rarely investigate circumstances that lead to irregular expenditure, in the process denying authorities an opportunity to determine whether there was impropriety involving public funds.Creecy, delivering the province's medium-term budget policy statement and adjustment budget yesterday in the Gauteng legislature, insisted that "the public purse must be used strategically and ethically. We want to make it clear that there is no tolerance for flouting supply chain management rules and regulations."
