Speaking to TshisaLIVE on Monday, Eric said that he was at an intersection in Greenstone, Johannesburg on Sunday evening when a man approached his vehicle.Sensing danger, Eric skipped the robot and sped off, only for the man to jump in a car and give chase.Eric said another car then joined the chase."The (other) car appeared in front of me and hit his brakes there and then I swerved to the left and sped off, skipping more robots," he added.Luckily for Eric, a police van spotted the chase and followed the cars."The police spotted me and followed me. The other cars sped off. When the police learned what had happened, they escorted me home in Linden. Apart from the shock, I'm okay, and grateful to be alive," Eric said.He later took to Instagram to pay tribute to the policemen who saved his life.Posting a picture of the officers, he wrote: "If it wasn't for the universe and these brothers...only God knows. Not one to talk, but f*ck! Thank you, guys."A photo posted by eric macheru (@ericmacheru) on Nov 6, 2016 at 12:23pm PSTA photo posted by eric macheru (@ericmacheru) on Nov 6, 2016 at 12:23pm PST Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
