This comes after swirling reports that Bongani and Tshedi are not on speaking terms."Last time I spoke to Bongani was around March/April when I asked him if we could meet, and he asked what would we be talking about. I told him that we would talk about Malaika. And he just never pitched," Tshedi told TshisaLIVE during an interview.However, speaking to Move!, Bongani revealed that Tshedi is "making it impossible" for them to get together in studio and record the one album that they still owe Sony."We signed a five-album contract with Sony Music and this means that we still owe Sony one last album. I want us to fulfil this obligation, but Tshedi is making it impossible," he told the local publication."I don't think Malaika will ever make a comeback."Bongani is instead focusing on his solo gospel project, Wonders of Mercy.He revealed in a statement that his new album was inspired by his single Ke Tshepile Wena."I finally decided to heed the calling after I had been avoiding it for some time," he said."It has finally caught up with me and I must say this has brought about such fulfilment inside of me, and my fans agree with this welcome and life empowering direction."
