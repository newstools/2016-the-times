Phahlane was responding to a report that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) had asked him make a warning statement in relation to a charge of defeating the ends of justice.The charge relates to IPID s probe into an upmarket house that Phahlane built in Pretoria. It is alleged Phahlane contacted witnesses after he learnt of the IPID probe. The report also states that an SMS had been sent to one of the IPID investigators involved in the probe.Phahlane s spokeswoman Brig Mashadi Selepe said the police service respects the mandate of IPID to investigate any member of the South African Police Service irrespective of who they are. The Acting National Commissioner welcomes any investigation on any allegations and matter against him conducted within the confines of the law to enable the testing of any such allegations. It is unfortunate that such investigations and/ or allegations if any are conducted through the media with the sole aim of causing harm and damage to the reputation and integrity of the Acting National Commissioner she said.IPID spokesman Moses Dlamini refused to comment at this stage saying the directorate feared this might jeopardise its investigations.
