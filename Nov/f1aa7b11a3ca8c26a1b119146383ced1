The venue is cited by the organisers of the pop up party spot as number 11 Blandford Road in the suburb made famous by the wealthy Gupta family.The party invitation has so far been shared with 1 300 people on Facebook with a small confirmed turnout of 168 going.The invite reads: For the last week the twittersphere has been aflood with searches and questions about the infamous Saxonwold Shebeen. Why isn t it on Google Maps? How much is a Johnny Black? Do they serve Gordhan s Gin? Is it bring and bribe? All these questions and more will be answered for the first time when the Saxonwold Shebeen opens its doors to the public .The doors will open at 7pm and entry will cost R6 that s knocking off some zeroes from the R600 million allegedly promised to a government official.For your rands you will get a beer while a DJ takes to the deck.The cheeky organisers are an electronic music events company which said on its Facebook page that some of the proceeds will go to a charity it endorses."Green Beings is in no way involved with the concept organization or running of this event. However a portion of the profits will be donated to a charity " Twin Peak Projects states.Parody accounts and memes have been doing the rounds on social media since Eskom CEO Brian Molefe last week became emotional and appeared to break down in tears while trying to explain his movements in Saxonwold the Johannesburg suburb where the Gupta family resides.His waterworks did not earn any sympathy from the Twitterati. Instead they latched on to Molefe s attempt to make light of the State of Capture findings with his chirp that he might have gone to a shebeen in Saxonwold and #SaxonwoldShebeen has been raising laughter ever since.
