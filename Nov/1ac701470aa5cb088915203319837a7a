The city s spokesman Kgamanyane Maphologela said the new billing regionalisation programme would start on February 1 2017 allowing ratepayers to choose their day of paying for services.He said the city was streamlining its billing operations which would result in improved billing accuracy the ability of customers to choose their own due dates regional meter reading reduced long-estimate billing and audit queries limiting collection dates and informed reporting per region.Maphologela said the billing regionalisation project essentially means the customers would be billed per the region the lived in.It also means the customers will be able to know exactly when the City would come to their area to read their meters. "We want to work faster and more efficiently by improving customers' experience. The current billing schedule is open all working days of the month consisting of 21 portions."Each portion caters for each regional township in the city which strains the physical meter reading that impacts on billing accuracy. Now we want to reduce the number of many portions and rather focus on each region and improve the quality of meter reading " said Maphologela.Maphologela added that once the system goes online the customers would have the freedom to choose their due dates between the 15th and the 28th of every month.If customers don't choose a date the due date will default to 15 days after billing. Maphologela said another advantage of the project was that customers would be able know exactly which region within the city their suburbs fall under.They would also be able to know the dates when the meter readers would visit their areas by tracking this on the City's website. The first phase of the project will start in regions A (Midrand) B (Randburg Northcliff Rosebank) C (Roodepoort) and E (Sandton).The other regions D (Soweto) F (Inner-city) and G (Lenasia Ennerdale) will be launched in May 2017.- TMG Digital
