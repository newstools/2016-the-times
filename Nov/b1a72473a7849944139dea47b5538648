The opposition party is also calling for the immediate resignation of Brown Zwane Molefe and the Eskom board following the release of allegations contained in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's state capture report. If Molefe does not resign he should be fired the party says.resignThe DA has already laid criminal charges against the Guptas and against Zuma's son Duduzane Zuma and will charge the president under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act for failing notify the police of Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas' statement that he had been offered the position of finance minister by the Guptas in exchange for R600 million and for allegedly having improperly influenced the appointment and awarding of contracts to family members friends and associates.Brown is alleged to have appointed Eskom board members consisting predominantly of individuals with direct and indirect business or personal relationships with the Gupta family and Zuma's son and for appointing Denel board members with links to a Gupta company.DA leader Mmusi Maimane said at a media briefing on Thursday that the party's motion of no confidence in Zuma is expected to be debated in the National Assembly next Thursday.He said the DA s campaign to solicit support for its motion would include "the lobbying of members of Parliament in the house including the ANC. This motion should not be viewed as a DA motion"."This is a South African motion " Maimane said. "I know that there are ANC MPs and Cabinet ministers who have had enough. They have an opportunity to actually do something about their anger next week Thursday."The DA will also call for Parliament to establish an ad hoc committee to deal with the report which Maimane said confirmed SA was governed by a mafia "a criminal syndicate so deeply interlinked with private crony interests that it is no longer possible to distinguish between the two".2The DA's public enterprises spokeswoman Natasha Mazzone said Parliament's portfolio committees had been "hoodwinked" for years as to the true state of play within state-owned enterprises and had been lied to.Maimane said the ruling party was itself captured. In Parliament the ANC had relied on majoritarianism at the expense of accountability and the truth. "Parliament has been reduced to an executive capture led by Zuma."The cancer of corruption had infused the ANC to such an extent that its vital organs were dysfunctional Maimane said.He noted that the DA had decided on a motion of no confidence in Zuma rather than a motion of impeachment as the former required only a simple majority and not the two-thirds majority required by the latter. Maimane hoped MPs "with backbone" would support the motion.The DA leader said it was not necessary to await the findings of the judicial commission of inquiry which the state capture report has directed must be established. The police had to investigate the suspected criminal activities. The Guptas needed to know that their final resting place was not Saxonwold or Dubai but prison Maimane said.- BusinessLive
