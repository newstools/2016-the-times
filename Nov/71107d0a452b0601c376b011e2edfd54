This comes as it emerged that Wits structures and managers did not respond timeously and sensitively to the concerns of a student who was allegedly raped on October 30 at the Wits Junction Residence by a fellow student.The incident caused such an uproar that it got #RapeAtJunction trending for most of Wednesday night."Yesterday I had a lengthy conversation with the complainant and her mother to hear about the incident and how the University s official structures responded to her complaint. I particularly enquired about her experience of the Office of Residence Life Student Affairs and the Gender Equity Office regarding her complaint " said Habib in a statement on Saturday.Furthermore the resident's house committee had accused the university of being slow to react to the crime."She explained that some individuals engaged with her more effectively than others and while some were extremely helpful and sensitive to her needs others had not been equally responsive to her situation. This suggests that it may be that particular processes and procedures of the University have not been fully complied with by certain individuals in these circumstances " added Habib.Habib said the investigation would be instituted immediately and would be concluded timeously by an experienced and dedicated university official dealing with issues of gender based politics and cultural matters at Wits.The investigator Nomboniso Gasa would report back to Habib within 72 hours.He added that a timeline would be communicated to the University community early next week.
