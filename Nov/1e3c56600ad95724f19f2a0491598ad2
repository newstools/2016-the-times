The headlong rush to nuclear has been dangerous for our economy and has been widely criticised as economically foolish because high building costs are locked into the nuclear project, whereas renewable energy is becoming more and more cost-efficient.In the words of UCT professor Robert Schire, as quoted by the Bloomberg news service, "Essentially, the project has been indefinitely postponed and the final decision on nuclear power will only be taken by [President Jacob] Zuma's successor. This is a great victory for economic rationality and political expediency, and reflects the new political balance of a weakened Zuma administration."The government's publication of some of its long-awaited energy plans puts the programme for nuclear power station construction back 15 years, meaning nuclear power generation could not contribute to the national grid before 2037.You would think that the nuclear lobby would finally accept that it has lost the argument.But not Eskom. It has said that it will invite by December tenders for the construction of nuclear power stations because it is possible, it says, that nuclear power will be required by 2025 - a mere 10 years away.The parastatal is proceeding as if there had not been a complete about-turn on nuclear power.It is manipulating the market to suit its nuclear ambitions.It is the sole distributor of electricity and is exploiting its monopoly to minimise the contribution of renewable energy to the nation's power mix.Its intention to invite tenders for nuclear power station construction by the end of this year is a desperate attempt by the nuclear lobby to keep its flawed vision alive.It must be stopped in its tracks.
