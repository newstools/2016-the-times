Briefing the media on Wednesday Mashaba said that said since the Democratic Alliance administration took over after the August 3 elections several investigations had been conducted."I can now tell you that I am inundated with these allegations forensic reports and questionable tenders all of which have been purposely hidden from the public-eye."I have a number of cases that are currently at advanced stages of forensic investigation. We will be releasing the outcome of these investigations soon because our approach is that we will share with you the outcomes of all investigations where wrong-doing is found " he said.Mashaba said the investigations were the reason the ANC was making a deliberate effort to collapse his government in council."There is a deep-rooted fear that this government will expose the corruption maladministration and nepotism that became the order of the day under the ANC administration. They are correct to fear this."Mashaba also announced the appointment of Sibiya as the new head of the city's internal investigations unit.Sibiya started his career in the Saps rising to the level of detective captain of the National Central Bureau Interpol Pretoria. He has served in the Directorate of Special Operations (Scorpions) as the chief special investigator heading the Free State Branch and also worked as a brigadier heading the Commercial Crimes unit of the Hawks before becoming the Provincial Head of the Hawks in Gauteng.Mashaba invited Sibiya to investigate anyone in the city including his office."I give you an open invitation to investigate me or any member of this government at any time you may deem necessary. You will have my full support in the work you are going to do but I require results."When I speak of results I mean there will be no golden handshakes no slaps on the wrist. I want to see corrupt people going to jail and monies being recovered."Sibiya's first task is to establish his unit in the city for it to function like a Chapter 9 institution like the public protector's office and then make sure that investigations already concluded in the city have been "carried out to the letter".Then he has to investigate tenders that have been awarded in the city to see if they have not been given to relatives of city officials.- TMG Digital
