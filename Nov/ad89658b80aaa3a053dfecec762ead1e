All the time.In the wake of a swirling debate around Statistics SA's latest report on Gender Patterns in Transport, which revealed that getting a driver's licence isn't common among black women, Lerato showed one hater flames.According to the report between 2003 and 2013 the number of black people who got driver's licences increased from 12 % to 17 %.Weighing-in on the debate Lerato and her Metro FM co-host Mo Flava, asked listeners about the topic."If you are a black woman over the age of 18 and don't have a drivers license what are you waiting for?," Lerato tweeted.It was then that the hater told Lerato that black people barely have money for basic needs. Majority of black women barely afford a sustainable livelihood. Why don't you pay for them the ridiculous fees involved? https://t.co/ACCYjhMK1T"Ibrahim Ibrahim!
