"We demand to know which objectives they are pursuing and how that benefits Gauteng [in the long term]," said Makhura.Thabo Masebe, deputy director-general, said: "They will either have to limit themselves to those countries that we have relations with or those countries that fit into the strategy we are pursuing as a province."
