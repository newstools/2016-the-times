On November 15 Zuma gave Abrahams Director of Public Prosecutions: North Gauteng Sibongile Mzinyathi and Acting Special Director of Public Prosecutions Torie Pretorius until today to give reasons why they should not be suspended pending an enquiry into their fitness to hold office.Zuma said his decision followed a request by civic society organisations Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation which raised concerns with the manner in which the three advocates conducted the prosecution of Minister Pravin Gordhan and two former South African Revenue Service officials.Zuma asked the three advocates to make written representations to him as to why they should not be placed on suspension and whether to hold an inquiry into their fitness to hold office.By Monday afternoon it had not yet been confirmed whether the prosecutors had made the representations or whether the president has received them.The DA said it was of utmost importance for all South African citizens that these reasons be publicly released given the impact that the undue decision to charge Gordon had on the economy.DA s shadow minister of justice Glynnis Breytenbach said Abrahams s decision to announce charges against Gordhan without first reviewing the matter himself was wholly unacceptable and consequently eroded R50 billion from the economy. It has been the DA s contention from the start of the debacle that President Zuma should suspend Abrahams pending investigation. Breytenbach said the public deserved to know the facts surrounding the spectacle of Gordhan s prosecution and subsequent withdrawal of charges. It is therefore of national importance that the President handles the rest of the process with complete transparency in doing so placing himself above suspicion she said.
