The four men, in their mid-30s, will face a disciplinary hearing to determine who was behind the wheel when they wildly spun a metro vehicle, leaving skid marks.A video showing the spinning VW Jetta was circulated on social media.Police spokesman Sbonelo Mchunu on Thursday said: "We have established that four officers might have possibly taken the car."Mchunu said one of the four would have had to have used his police tag to start the car.He said the policemen will be grilled at a disciplinary hearing.The video got mixed responses online, with Facebook users divided on whether the metro police officer was a hero for attempting the tricky stunt.But other Facebook users called for official sanction.Pavaroti Caruso commented: "What's the big deal. He was practising his driving skills."You never know when he may need to do a doughnut while in hot pursuit of a suspect."Marie James wrote on Facebook that the guilty officer was abusing police resources."New tyres and any necessary repairs for his private account. No wonder so many essential-services vehicles are out of commission."As for the culprit's driving skills, Facebook users were divided.Muzo Muzo said: "He's got good skills. This is what you need to catch runaway criminals. Good car control."Horathius Weimers said: "That wasn't doughnuts. That was just going around in a circle fast."
