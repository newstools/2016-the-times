This week club football gives way to internationals, with most of the games being World Cup 2018 qualifiers in various confederations.In Polokwane tomorrow afternoon, Bafana Bafana lock horns with Senegal in an encounter of utmost importance to our chances of qualifying for the World Cup finals in Russia.We had a disappointing draw in our opening match against Burkino Faso away (1-1) and have to win our home games to stand a chance of topping the group and joining four other African countries for the world's premier football event.Our chances? No more than 50-50 against a team that are firm favourites to win Group D and I do like the draw at odds of 2-1.The value bet of the World Cup weekend is in the African Confederation with home team Cameroon to defeat Zambia at 6-10.The weekend multiple bet:Cameroon at 6/10France at home to beat Sweden at odds of 1-4Slovakia (home) to outclass Lithuania at 4-10Belgium, at odds of 1-3, to be leading at half-time against visiting EstoniaThis four-match all-to-go will give a nice return of around 7-2.All odds quoted are supplied by Betting World and are subject to change.
