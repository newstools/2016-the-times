 The findings in the report by previous public protector Thuli Madonsela that he may have breached the Executive Ethics Code for allegedly allowing the Guptas and his son Duduzane to be involved in appointing cabinet ministers must be the last straw.The writing is on the wall: Zuma's days in the Union Buildings are numbered.Yesterday, under the Save South Africa banner, South Africans from all walks of life took to the streets in Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban to say enough is enough. Today more than 100 ANC veterans are expected to add their voices to the call for Zuma to step down.The individuals who are now joining the chorus are not only the usual suspects, but, until very recently, staunch backers of Zuma's ANC.The presence of ANC Gauteng chairman Paul Mashatile and the third senior leader in the SA Communist Party Solly Mapaila at the Save SA Pretoria gathering is evidence that the tide has turned against Zuma.Voices expressing dissatisfaction with his leadership are getting louder as more damning evidence of his misgovernance emerges. It started with his own cabinet ministers who came out publicly in support of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The decision by the National Prosecuting Authority to drop the fraud charges against Gordhan emboldened more people to stand up.The National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Unionadded its voice. Even ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said those calling for Zuma to resign were talking to his conscience, meaning that Zuma no longer has Luthuli House on his side.The only party structures he can rely on are the discredited ANC Youth League, the ANC Women's League and the uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association.His decision to withdraw his application to interdict the release of the report is a sign he has played all his cards.The end is nigh.
