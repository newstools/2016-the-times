Although the EFF backed the DA in electing Herman Mashaba as the city's mayor, the parties have already started to disagree over what money should be spent on.The council had approved three major development projects under its Corridors of Freedom initiative under former mayor Parks Tau.They include the redevelopment of Wemmer Pan, Milpark and Balfour Park.According to council documents, the initiative aims to transform Balfour Park from a low-density suburb into a mixed-use, walkable, urban environment.It also hoped to attract investment to Milpark through spatial transformation.The EFF, however, has labelled the plans "suburban Botox" where poor residents are unlikely to benefit."The DA and the ANC decided against our guidance to pump billions towards building walkways, parks and renovating racecourses ... and extending bicycle lanes in Milpark, Balfour Park and Wemmer Pan," said the EFF Johannesburg regional secretary Silumko Mabona.He said while the EFF agreed with the principles of the Corridors of Freedom initiative, the council should rather focus on building houses and roads for the poor.MMC for development planning and urban management Funzela Ngobeni said the EFF was free to differ and express views on any issue. " Parties are entitled to express their views in a democracy," he said."The new administration supports the Corridors of Freedom project," said Ngobeni.The budget for the project is yet to be tabled.
