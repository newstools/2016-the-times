Julius has in the past accused the company's ownership of alleged fraud and racketeering.But taking to Twitter on Wednesday, the EFF leader showed that his feelings for the label do not extend to some of its artists.Posting a picture of a music video from Mabala Noise's Major League DJs, Julius wrote: "Boys and Boys, the problem is Mabala Noise but otherwise the music is proper".Julius made headlines in August when he said during a live press conference that the company is headed up by ANC Youth League treasurer general Reggie Nkabinde, and that it paid no less than R5 million to artists signed to the label. He further added that Mabala is funded through dodgy government tenders.Reggie rubbished the claims and said that the company was looking into taking legal action against the EFF leader.EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi later told Sowetan that the party had opened racketeering and fraud cases against Reggie.
