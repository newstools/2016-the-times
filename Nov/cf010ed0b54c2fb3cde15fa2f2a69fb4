There is also an understanding that there would be no disruptions to exams or university activities said university spokesperson Shirona Patel. Wits University s management and student leaders reached consensus that there will be two sittings for the examinations - the current sitting and the second sitting in December or January depending on the faculty she said. Students have to apply for the second sitting by midday on Friday November 25 so that the university can allow for proper planning and scheduling. Students who had already applied for deferred examinations will automatically be allowed to participate in the second sitting depending on the faculty.Earlier this month an application on behalf of students to have year-end examinations postponed until next year saying they felt traumatised and there was little time to prepare because of protests was dismissed by the South Gauteng High Court.The Wits student representative council and a senior management team started exploring the possibility of two exam sittings last Monday.Wits Fees Must Fall leader Mcebo Dlamini after being granted R2000 bail by the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court last week had urged vice-chancellor Prof Adam Habib to give students two chances two writing their final year examinations.He said deferring exams would be like sudden death for students. We strongly feel that the conditions on the ground were not conducive and palatable. The police oppression the curfew libraries closed and the violence on campus have not made things easy for us and that is why we requested the university to concede giving us two sittings said Dlamini.
