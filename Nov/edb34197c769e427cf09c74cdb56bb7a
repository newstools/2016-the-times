The application was made they said in a statement after Malema despite his recent court appearance on charges of incitement simply continued to incite people to occupy land . Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees property rights and that no economy can function or grow without this right AfriBusiness spokesperson Stefan Pieterse said on Wednesday night. The application is brought to protect this fundamental right and to be able to charge Malema with contempt of court and even have him found guilty and incarcerated should he transgress again. AfriBusiness said it had also on Wednesday laid charges against Malema after he threatened that the safety of businesses could not be guaranteed during an EFF protest march to support Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan . The march went ahead and many businesses suffered damages after these were looted a statement said. Malema and the EFF were given five days to indicate whether or not they will oppose the application. Malema had twice in the space of a week appeared in different courts charged under the Riotous Assemblies Act for allegedly inciting his supporters to invade land.Both cases were postponed after Malema s lawyers indicated that they intend to contest the constitutionality of the law.Malema addressing supporters outside the Bloemfontein Magistrate s Court last Monday reiterated the party s call for people to occupy land.AfriForum laid the charges in that case while his appearance in a Newcastle court a week earlier was to answer charges laid by the state.
