The 28-year-old defender has found himself on the sidelines with new signing Limbikani Mzava taking his place alongside Nkanyiso Mngwengwe as the preferred centre back pairing in the past few matches.The utility defender though says he is putting in the hard work at training in a bid to cement a starting place in the team and the Highlands match provided him with the necessary foundation. I think I played very well and I just need to work on picking up my confidence. This game was actually about me gaining the confidence that I need because I ve been out of the game for a quite a while said the Arrows captain. I've been pushing myself hard at training so that I can play and compete for a place in the starting line-up. I wasn t injured you know. I think when there are new players coming in at the beginning of the season you have to compete and we just have to keep on supporting each other. Who plays doesn't matter much what matters the most is the team. If the team is doing well we are all happy. Clinton Larsen will have a nice headache when he names his centre back pairing for Wednesday's Absa Premiership encounter against Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld Stadium with Mgwengwe available after serving his one-match suspension. I want to play more games as possible so that I can attract the eyes of the national team selectors. I'm pushing myself very at training but my aim to keep continue to work hard at training so that I cement a regular starting place in my team added Mathiane.
