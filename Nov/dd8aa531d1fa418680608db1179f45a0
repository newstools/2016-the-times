For those who aren't acquainted with the cult show that ruled teen girl TV viewership from 2000 to 2007, here's a quick recap: the show follows the quick-witted banter of mother-and-daughter duo Lorelai and Rory Gilmore and the lives they lead in small town Stars Hollow, Connecticut.To the horror of her well-to-do parents, Richard and Emily, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) had Rory (Alexis Bledel) when she was 16. At the close of the seventh season Lorelai had been engaged four times, married once, burnt down the inn in which she raised Rory, built a new one that she ran with Melissa McCarthy and drank a helluva lot of coffee.Rory went to a fancy school, and then Yale, she made bad life choices with three boys and also drank a helluva lot of coffee.Considering that the show had a total of 153 episodes that's not an awful lot of events, but therein lies the beauty- it feels like you're following the lives of a couple of your friends.There are no spies, explosives, murders or vampires. Just white people talking fast, drinking a lot of coffee and living their lives.In one episode they have to move furniture. In another, they have a knitting contest to raise money for a bridge and there's one that centre s on a funeral for a cat . Sure, people cheat, fight, get married and have unexpected twins, but nothing extraordinary happens - and that's great.It was the perfect show about girls for a generation of girls who learnt it was cool to be smart, stick up for other girls and follow your dreams, and that nice boys make great boyfriends, but sometimes misunderstood "bad" boys turn out to be the best boys of all.It was a show that professed that friends could be family, but that family would always come first. It's these ideas that made it a hit years ago (after it was bought by Netflix, popularity surged again).So the obvious outcome is the continuation of the series - with the original creator at the helm.After a dispute over money the network kicked creator and head writer Sherman-Palladino to the curb at the end of Season 6 and filmed the last season with new producers, so those four words were left unuttered in an awful season in which characters didn't sound like themselves and made peculiar decisions that the fans, the actors themselves and the ratings hated. Now we finally get to watch the ending that fans always deserved.Season 8 picks up the storyline 10 years later with four feature- length episodes, each of which follows a season in a single year of the lives of the three Gilmore women.Lorelai is still with fianc No3, Luke (Scott Patterson) but she feels that her life is in a rut; Rory is a freelance journalist unsure of where her life is going; and grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop) has to figure out what to do with her life after the death of her husband, Richard (following the death of the real-life actor Edward Herrmann).There are promises of a musical, town meetings, reunions with all of Rory's ex-boyfriends, a cameo by McCarthy and those final four words.But I'm hoping they stick to the original idea and that nothing much happens.Watch very little happen in "Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life" on Netflix
