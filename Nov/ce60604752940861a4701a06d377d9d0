She's a complete sport package &amp; lovely to watch After four years at the helm of SoccerZone, Minnie shocked fans when she announced that she would be leaving the show "grow" and "focus on other business ventures"."I have resigned from SABC Sport to focus on my other business ventures. I have loved my time with the SABC Sport family and will miss them dearly. It pains me to realize that I won't be seeing my Thom Thom (Thomas Mlambo) and Dr Mnandi every Monday as they have become family," Minnie said in a statement."I need to grow and explore various opportunities in entertainment and business. I'm super excited about 2017 and working very hard to make it a success." </img> Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
