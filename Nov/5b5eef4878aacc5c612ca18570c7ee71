Tiger Brands issued a warning to consumers on Monday after it emerged that Rabalago used the spray to heal worshippers at the Mount Zion General Assembly (MZGA) at the weekend.Photographs of the services and testimonies were posted on Rabalago s and MZGA's Facebook accounts causing a social media outcry. We find this practice alarming and extremely concerning and want to make it very clear that is it unsafe to spray any Doom or any aerosol onto people's faces. Doom has been formulated to kill specific insects which are detailed on the cans and the packaging has very clear warnings which must be adhered to. Using this product for purposes other than what it is intended for poses risks and is therefore dangerous. Tiger Brands is in the process of contacting the Prophet to ask him to refrain from such practice the company said in a statement.Rabalago said none of his flock has been injured by the Doom he used on them.He has also used fire and petrol to "heal" congregants he told TMG Digital.
