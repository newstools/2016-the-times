Zwane appeared before Parliament's mineral resources committee to explain his appointment of his chief of staff Sepati Dlamini as acting deputy director-general of mineral policy in the department.The appointment has been questioned by Democratic Alliance (DA) mineral resources spokesman James Lorimer who has expressed concern over what he said seemed an irregular appointment to what was a highly technical and specialised position which also involved the processing of mining licences.He said Dlamini had only been involved in the mining sector for about one year.Dlamini was previously employed in the Free State agriculture department as a financial officer and had allegedly made an irregular payment to a Gupta-linked dairy venture in the province. She has also worked in the Northern Cape provincial government.Zwane told MPs that Dlamini had the necessary experience and had worked in government for some time. He insisted that all due processes had been followed in appointing Dlamini who met the necessary requirements.Zwane found it very odd that questions were raised over an appointment which at this stage was only an acting one.The minister also the questioned the right of committee members to probe such administrative matters of his department. He said it would be problematic if the committee conducted its business on the basis of rumours and expected him to come to Parliament to answer questions on this basis.ANC MPs once again leapt to the minister's defence arguing that the DA was objecting to Dlamini's appointment because she was a woman. The department was trying to promote women.ANC MP Zwelivelile Mandela said he was satisfied with the minister's response. Here is a black woman who has been empowered but it comes under scrutiny.
