"We had asked the university to give us at least an opportunity to have a January (examination) sitting. We [want] two sittings; those who are ready to write now in November [and] an opportunity to write in January " said FeesMustFall leader Mcebo Dlamini.Dlamini 30 was granted R2000 bail in Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. He is facing charges of public violence theft malicious damage to property and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm following. His next court appearance is on November 15 at the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court.He said deferring exams would be like "sudden death" for students. "We strongly feel that the conditions on the ground were not conducive and palatable. The police oppression the curfew libraries closed and the violence on campus have not made things easy for us and that is why we are requesting the university to concede giving us two sittings."Another thing that will be on the agenda of the meeting is that we are requesting the university to give us an amnesty committee so that we can discuss the issues of students who are charged and suspended added the student leader. The amnesty is not only for students alone the university itself must apologise for things it has done to us (students)."Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel was not immediately available for comment.The management and SRC meeting is expected to run until late in the afternoon.
