And if you think that is far-fetched, proceedings at the Equality Court yesterday might indicate otherwise.The case, which centres on hate speech, was brought by Timothy Trengrove-Jones, a tenant at Gleneagles flats in Killarney, Johannesburg.Trengrove-Jones, a homosexual, alleges that fellow tenant Elvira Oelofse called him "a f*****g old queen" during an altercation in July.On that day, Timothy O'Connor and two of his employees, hired by Trengrove-Jones and the body corporate, were covering plumbing ducts that pigeons were occupying.Trengrove-Jones testified that he heard yelling and following the "shrieks" to their source found Oelofse "body-blocking" the duct on which O'Connor and his men were trying to work.In a video shown to the court, Oelofse is seen yelling at the men to stop covering the duct and to get away from her property.When the men attempt to set up their ladders she is heard shouting that they are physically violating her and warning them that she knew Japanese martial arts.Oelofse and Trengrove-Jones are then seen arguing, with Oelofse telling Trengrove-Jones that he is "common" and "disgusting".Trengrove-Jones's testimony was that later in the altercation she called him "a f*****g old queen", which Oelofse neither confirmed nor denied."This insult was based on my identity as a gay male [and] . aimed to mock me on the basis of my sexuality," he said."She caused me personal trauma and distress, which I believe was her intention."Oelofse, through her attorney, said that she wanted to protect the birds because the nets in the ducts would cause their death.Trengrove-Jones is seeking an apology and R50,000 in damages.
