The South African squad held a full-field training match at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Tuesday morning ahead of the fixture against the Lions of Teranga at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (3pm).Mashaba was pleased that four goals were scored including one by new 1.96-metre Dutch-born call-up Lars Veldwijk. I was happy four goals were scored. And I was saying Why was it not this Saturday so at least we could say that we ve got four goals? Mashaba said after Bafana s first session. But we re happy with what we re seeing there is that little bit of promise. There are boys especially on the striking force one or two players who I think should have the country bracing themselves for good strikers coming up. We are happy that they are coming through this national team. Goals were scored and chances created that s what we want to see. Mashaba said he could see Veldwijk s potential even from one practise outing. That s what we brought him for. He could have scored more than three but you can see the confidence is still coming the coach said. I spoke to him about it and said Show a little bit of confidence . And I think he ll be better in the later sessions. What people must understand is that it s not about when you come into the team you show yourself in the training sessions. That s when we select the team. But from what I ve seen this morning there is a promise that he can give us what we need up-front in terms of finishing. You ve seen his body he s taller than me! He s on the level of the crossbar. Bafana have one point in Group D after an away draw against Burkina Faso. Senegal lead the group with three points after beating Cape Verde Islands 2-0 at home.The group winners progress to Russia 2018. - TMG Digital
