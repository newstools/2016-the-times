Lucille Blumberg, deputy director of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, yesterday added her voice to concerns about adult patients infecting children due to poor infection control and incomplete drug treatment."The key is ensuring that adults with TB are identified and treated early, and that their treatment is completed," she said."Adults are the source [of infection] for children - it is not children who pass it on from children. TB in children can be very severe," she said.Blumberg's comments reinforce concerns voiced by the City of Cape Town, which oversees one of the biggest treatment programmes. Cape Town is considered the epicentre of the country's TB epidemic among kids, with about 1500 children treated every year.The city appealed to parents to screen their children for TB if there was any chance of their having been in contact with a TB patient.About 1% of the population develops active TB every year, according to recent statistics published on a popular TB website. About 80% of South Africans carry latent TB, with the highest prevalence among the poor in dense townships or informal settlements.Blumberg said there was at least progress with the government's HIV/Aids antiretroviral programme, which reduces TB infection rates. Widespread use of rapid TB-diagnosis kits was also positive."A lot of money has been spent on that, but it hasn't always translated into getting patients onto treatment," she said.A recent Wits University feasibility study supports using drones to combat TB by transporting microbiological samples from remote areas to testing labs.
