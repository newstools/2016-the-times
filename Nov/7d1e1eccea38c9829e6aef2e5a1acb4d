Philander took 5/21 his 10th five-wicket haul and his first since February 2013.The fast bowler delivered the key performance in making Australia slump to their lowest total on home soil in 32 years. But he was reluctant to take his share of the credit. This wicket together with the overheard conditions this morning probably suited us to the T Philander said. It was a magnificent allround effort - catches need to be taken and there was a magnificent runout. All those things add up to a collective team effort to bowl a team out. You need those things to go your way. Everyone s speeds were here. But it was still a job well done. Whether you bowl 115 km an hour or 150 km an hour if you bowl a team out for 85 anyone will take that. Philander was off the field for the second half of the morning session after a collision with Australian captain Steve Smith. I was busy appealing so I didn t have my eyes focused on him Philander said. He jammed me with his elbow. He was ball-watching. He hit me on the shoulder. I felt pain straight away. Luckily we ve got the best physio in the world (Brandon Jackson) and he managed to get me back onto the park pretty quickly. These things happen. It s part of the game. I m just glad that I can still be part of the game. It could have been much worse. There s a bit of muscle soreness but hopefully I ll be OK pretty soon. South Africa were 171/5 at stumps a lead of 86.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
