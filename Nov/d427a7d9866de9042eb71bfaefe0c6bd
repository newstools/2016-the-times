Admore Ndlovu took the witness stand at the South Gauteng High Court sitting at Palm Ridge Magistrate s Court on Thursday to dispute claims that he had confessed to the murder of Sizwe Tyele his friend Zukisa Kela and the rape of their female partners in October 2015.The incident took place at Johannesburg's Rhodes Park in Kensington. Ndlovu and his co-accused Thabo Nkala and Mduduzi Mathibela are on trial for murder rape and robbery.Colonel Miriam Ndlovu who took the confession statement from Ndlovu at Lenasia Police Station testified that the suspect understood English and the two communicated in both English and Zulu. However the suspect denied this saying he didn't understand English and later testified that he even failed the language at school in Zimbabwe.As Ndlovu was being sworn in before testifying he had the court in stitches as judge Jonas Masopa noted that he could actually understand the English language. Sir I'm noting that you responded to your counsel's questions (asked in English) without using an interpreter the judge said disapprovingly.Ndlovu instead smiled and looked down to compose himself.His lawyer advocate Robert Xaba led him in English during his examination in chief with an assistance of a Zulu interpreter. However this did not seem to impress the judge. Mr Ndlovu I don't understand you. You are still answering English questions before they get interpreted to you in Zulu. That's shows that you understand English the judge stated.Ndlovu responded: Your honour I do understand a little bit but I can't speak it...I was taught English at school but I was failing it. State prosecutor Mutuwa Nengovhela joined the fray when he quizzed Ndlovu about the exact age of his daughter. Mr Ndlovu you were not only bad in English you are bad in numbers too isn't it? The trial continues.TMG Digital/Sowetan
