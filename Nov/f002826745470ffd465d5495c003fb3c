The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is planning to hold a night vigil on Sunday evening ahead of EFF leader Julius Malema s appearance in the Bloemfontein Magistrate s Court on Monday for allegedly inciting his supporters to invade land.The charges under the Riotous Assemblies Act relate to a statement the EFF leader made two years ago.Malema told the EFF s elective conference in Bloemfontein in 2014 that: "We are going to occupy the unoccupied land because we need the land. For us to eat we must have the land. For us to work we must have the land... I come from Seshego. If there is unoccupied land we will go and occupy the land with my branch. You must go and do the same in the branch where you come from."He recently appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate s Court in KwaZulu-Natal on similar charges.The vigil will be held at the Batho Community Hall in Bochabela next to the Batho Police Station and close to the Bloemfontein Magistrate s Court.
