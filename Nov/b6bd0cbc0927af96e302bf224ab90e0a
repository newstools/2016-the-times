Dismissing the application by Freedom Under Law and The Helen Suzman Foundation with costs yesterday, Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo,his deputy Judge Aubrey Ledwaba, and Judge Mamoloko Kubushi ruled the grounds for urgency were insufficient.The application was to force Zuma to suspend Abrahams, NPA special litigation unit head Tori Pretorius and Gauteng sdirector of public prosecutions Sibongile Mzinyathi for their handling of the charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Zuma had given the three until Monday to provide reasons why they should not be suspended. Our view is based on the president s response Mlambo said.
