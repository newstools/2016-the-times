The EFF said it condemns President Jacob Zuma's statement during the Parliament question and answer session yesterday about the remedial action as recommended by the Public Protector in the State of Capture Report.Responding to questions in relation to the State of Capture Report Zuma said "no one no matter what position they hold can instruct the president to establish a commission and even tell the process through which you must go".The EFF said Zuma made this comment without even grounding it in law or entertaining the grounds upon which Advocate Thuli Madonsela as former Public Protector made the proposal."We want to guarantee him that we are not going to allow him in his continuation to undermine the constitution of the republic. If Zuma is not happy with the remedial action as recommended by the Public Protector he must challenge it through a court process. The remedial action of the public protector can only be reviewed through a judicial process otherwise they apply and must be implemented. "Zuma has not learned from the Nkandla process which ended in the constitutional court forcing him to pay back the money."The EFF said the State of Capture Report is clear that the reason the Chief Justice must recommend a judge who Zuma must appoint to constitute an inquiry "because he himself Zuma is a subject of such an inquiry"."This recommendation is based on the fact that our constitutional provisions never anticipated that appointment of judicial commissions which are the prerogative of the president could be constituted to investigate the president himself/herself. This limitation is what drives the Public Protector to make a recommendation of this manner. If Zuma feels otherwise he must be prepared to answer to the courts as to what must be done in order to hold him accountable in relation to allegations that he has grossly violated the Executive Code of Ethics. One thing that we shall never accept is that nothing must be done..."
