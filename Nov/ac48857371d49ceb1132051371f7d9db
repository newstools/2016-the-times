Twenty primary school children suffered medical-related emergencies from a suspected poisoning on Wednesday morning.Lesufi earlier took to Twitter to express shock at the incident. Why will an adult try to 'poison or drug' hundreds of kids at school nogal #Heartless! Be well my kids Papa love you so much! Activist Yusuf Abramjee shared Lesufi s pictures as he met the children at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. ER24 s Russel Meiring said paramedics assessed the children at The Hill in Johannesburg South and found that 20 were complaining of abdominal pain as well as nausea and vomiting . The patients were immediately treated and thereafter transported to South Rand and Baragwanath hospitals for urgent care Meiring said. The children later told paramedics that they had apparently been given sweets by an unknown man the previous day. ER24 paramedics urge all parents to teach their children not to accept sweets or gifts from strangers.
