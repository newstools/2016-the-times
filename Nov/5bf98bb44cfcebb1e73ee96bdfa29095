Sitting down for a chat with TshisaLIVE this week, the star said that she is tired of the messages and wants girls to stop blowing up her inbox with the requests."I get inboxes from girls asking me to introduce them to a rich man. No! I am not an agent. I tell them to go get a job and learn to be independent. It tell them: 'Have you tried getting a job? Get yourself a job. Go to school,''' Mshoza said.The star said that she will always help a fan in need, but she has learnt to draw the line."I am helping girls that want an education -I just paid for a girl to go to school. I would help a person who says that they need a job or need money for school, but I won't help a girl look for a rich man," Mshoza saidMshoza believes that she gets the messages because people think she is a gold digger."I'm not a gold digger. I love, and I love hard, but it's not about the money. I'm never in a relationship for money. Hence I left my man with his money and came back to Joburg and started from scratch- because I was never in it for money. I work for my money," she added.
