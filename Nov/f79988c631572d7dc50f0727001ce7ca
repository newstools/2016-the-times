Mojoro had gone nine games without a goal for City after joining from Orlando Pirates in August, but showed the best of his predatory instincts to down Celtic.The win leaves Eric Tinkler s side fifth in the table, while for Celtic it was a fourth game without a win and a continuation of the poor form that saw coach Serame Letsoaka get the sack at the weekend. Both sides sprung a surprise with their starting goalkeepers as City brought in Samora Motloung in the place of Shu-Aib Walters for his first start since the opening day of the season.And Celtic co-coaches Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka dropped stalwart Celtic gloveman Patrick Tignyemb to the bench and brought in Ayanda Mtshali for his Phunya Sele Sele debut and first PSL start in almost two years. City also handed a debut late on to Ghana Under-20 defender Joseph Adjei as he came off the bench for the final few minutes.Celtic should have had the lead on 13 minutes when a poor mistake from City left-back Ebrahim Seedat Celtic to break, but Atusaye Nyondo could only poke the ball wide with the goal gaping. Deon Hotto then laid on a perfect square-ball for Moeketsi Mvula as the visitors continued to press, but the forward fluffed his left-footed shot and City were able to clear. Nyondo went closer when his header came back off the crossbar with Motloung beaten all ends up, but it was the home side who grabbed the lead midway through the first period.Celtic skipper Wandisile Letlabika attempted to head back to keeper Mtshali, but Majoro read the play superbly and latched onto the loose ball to open his account for City.The forward might have had another just before the hour-mark when Ebrahim Seedat s excellent cross from deep picked him out on the edge of the six-yard box, but he could not steer his header on target.The excellent Lebo Manyama went on a thrilling run to the edge of the Celtic box and cleverly squared the ball for an on-rushing Bongi Jayiya, but he could only steer his shot straight into the midriff of Mtshali. Motloung made to fine stops in the closing seconds to secure the victory for City as a desperate Celtic piled on the pressure.Next up for City is their Telkom Knockout quarterfinal away at Baroka FC on Saturday, while Celtic will have an idle weekend having already been knocked out of the competition by tonight s opponents in the Last 16 stage.
