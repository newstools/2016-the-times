It almost seems an affront to the awesome prowess of Downs that Ajax would even consider venturing into the water rather than remaining within the safety of the shoreline for Wednesday night s match-up at Cape Town Stadium. Kickoff is at 7:30pm.Then again anyone who watches the Discovery Channel will know that even penguins can escape great whites on occasion.Returning from hunting grounds where Downs have had bigger fish to catch - winning the Caf Champions League - was initially not so easy even for Pitso Mosimane s winning machine.They lost against Cape Town City in the league and then on penalties against SuperSport United in the Telkom Knockout quarterfinals.To say they ve found their stride even with the Fifa Club World Cup (CWC) beckoning as a distraction would be an understatement.Downs would not mind keeping up the momentum in their last two matches against Ajax then Free State Stars at Loftus Versfeld on December 3 before their departure for Japan where the Brazilians play their first game on December 11.And not just for the CWC. Sundowns are well aware of the backlog in matches they will face next year and the more PSL points they can pick up now the more chance they have of defending their title.Plus some of Downs fringe new signings players like Ricardo Nascimento Sibusiso Vilakazi and Thapelo Morena who were not available in the Champions League but are for the CWC have been gaining a frightening head of steam.Mosimane has not even minded the absence through injury of Khama Billiat and Keagan Dolly who have earned a much-needed rest on the sidelines so long as Downs have kept winning and fringe players have gained in form. All of which once Dolly and Billiat return will make for an imposing on-form combination packed with depth at the CWC.And Sundowns have been winning with three victories since the Telkom defeat against SuperSport which have seen 12 goals scored to one in reply. Their last result was their 5-0 thrashing of third-last Highlands Park at Loftus where the burgeoning talent of Percy Tau played a hand in all five goals.Now Downs turn their attention to second-last Ajax who have only won one game in 10.The Urban Warriors have at least looked more solid in new coach Stanley Menzo s two games in charge. But the penguin had better get maneuvering if it wants to avoid being a snack for this great white. TMG Sport
