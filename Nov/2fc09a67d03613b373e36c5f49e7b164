He prefers to use solar energy to light up his evenings, listen to the radio or watch television, after abandoning a diesel generator he said burned fuel too quickly."Solar panels are a good, cheap solution," he said.Across the continent consumers are choosing their own off-grid solar solutions to power homes and small businesses.According to International Energy Agency projections, almost a billion people in sub-Saharan Africa will gain access to the electric-power grid by 2040, but by that time 530million will still be off-grid, not all that much fewer than the 600million who cannot access power today."The grid and off-grid solutions are so far apart right now that it's creating a huge space for innovation," enthuses Andrew Herscowitz, co-ordinator for US President Barack Obama's Power Africa initiative.Power Africa, which identifies governments and businesses requiring sustainable and affordable energy, and offers funding and expertise in more than 15 countries, has taken a particular interest in solar.Power Africa is pushing this renewable source so that people "don't have to wait for the grid to arrive, they can have a solar panel put on their roof," Herscowitz said.Half of sub-Saharan Africa's power is generated in South Africa, but north Africa has built effective grid systems that provide a constant flow of energy.But, for the rest, off-grid systems and the technology needed to make them reachable by the sub-continent's poorest have reached a tipping point in the past five years, spurred by advances that have lowered costs.In Kenya, micro-solar companies have brought power to 30% of the off-grid population."A person can, for the same they were spending to buy paraffin, buy a small solar panel that can power safe lightbulbs," Herscowitz said.Simon Bransfield-Garth, CEO of British pay-as-you-go solar panel company Azuri, noted that the cost per kilowatt hour for electricity in the West was about 15c (about R3) - but paraffin was 53 times more expensive and candles 105 times more expensive on average for African consumers.Azuri and rival M-Kopa offer a package of solar-powered lightbulbs, radio, and phone charging ports for as little as 50c a day.Solar-powered televisions are available for a little more and fridges are expected to follow.The companies have made their mark in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ghana, which also have the heaviest uptake of mobile-money systems, allowing users to pay for these services automatically through cheap and easy-to-access bank accounts provided by telecoms groups.Consultancy KPMG said in a recent report that solar power is "the most widely available source of renewable energy in Africa" and could "bring energy to virtually any location in Africa without the need for expensive large-scale developments."
