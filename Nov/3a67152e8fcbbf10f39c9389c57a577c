The common perception is that celebrities and famous personalities have everything good in life handed to them on a silver platter. Some are even born with the golden spoon in their mouth. While all the rest of the common folk stare up at them with love or hate, eyes filled with either jealousy or stars.However, taking to Instagram on Wednesday, Lesley revealed that being a celebrity isn't all that "glamorous"."People think that what we do is very glamorous, no it's not," the actor wrote."Most of us do this out of passion."He revealed that what motivates him is the fact that he is given the platform (through his work) to "change people's lives" by just being himself."The fact that I can change people's lives by just being me and illicit such responses gives me more reason to wake up and do what I do.Sometimes I think, why must I pose and take pictures with people given the challenges that I deal with? Something says to me, it's not about you, I gave you this fame to touch and change people's lives," he revealed.
