Chiefs were held to a 1-1 draw by SuperSport United in an entertaining match but the fans voiced their unhappiness with the embattled coach.AmaKhosi are struggling at the moment and Komphela has been singled out as the main reason for Chiefs' poor run of form.The contest itself was decided in the first half after Thabo Mnyamane's opening goal for United in the 30th minute and George Lebese's equaliser almost immediately.The sprinkling of supporters who braved the early evening showers that swept across parts of Johannesburg on Wednesday night and attended the game certainly got their money's worth as the two sides didn't hold back, especially in the first half.United, led by the troublesome Jeremy Brockie, kept the AmaKhosi rearguard on their toes and Chiefs did likewise in the opposite end of the pitch.It was United who finally broke the deadlock half an hour into the game when that man Brockie provided a devastating cross behind the Chiefs defense and a grateful Mnyamane stuck the ball into the top corner of the net.The few traveling United supporters were still celebrating the goal when play swung to the opposite end of the pitch and Lebese calmly turned inside the area, picked his spot and stuck the ball past goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse's reach.Lebese should have given Chiefs the lead moments later when his curling shot beat Pieterse but didn't bend enough at the crucial moment, finally sneaking just inches past the upright.Willard Katsande should have also given Chiefs the lead on the stroke of halftime when his thunderbolt took a wicked deflection and flew past the bemused PieterseThe ball seemed to be destined to hit the roof of the net but the crossbar came to Pieterse's rescue and it ricocheted off the post before finally falling into the relieved goalkeeper's hands.United had the final word of the first half and Khune had to make a brilliant ground save in the last kick of the period to deny Brockie. The game was less open in the second half and the two sides were a lot more measured in their approach. But Brockie continued to make a nuisance of himself, giving Chiefs plenty to think about on numerous occasions.Chiefs fans were up in arms late in the second half when Komphela substituted Lebese with Emmanuel Letlotlo.They were fuming and they let the Chiefs coach know exactly what they thought of his decision.There might have been some justification to their angry feelings as Chiefs lost their sting after Lebese's departure and seldom troubled United. - TMG Digital
