Researchers said their findings indicated that thoughts of mortality could be used as a powerful motivator, not just for sports but for many different performance-related activities.The study, published in the Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology, sought to examine the effects of Terror Management Theory.Study co-leader Uri Lifshin of the University of Arizona told Medical News Today: "Terror management theory talks about striving for self-esteem and why we want to accomplish things in our lives and be successful."Your subconscious tries to find ways to defeat death, to make death not a problem and the solution is self-esteem."Self-esteem gives you a feeling that you're part of something bigger, that you have a chance for immortality, that you have meaning, that you're not just a sack of meat."In one experiment researchers asked basketball players to complete one of two questionnaires before playing a short game of one-on-one basketball.One of the questionnaires asked them about their feelings about death and the other asked about their feelings about basketball.Those who completed the "death" questionnaire showed a 40% improvement in their personal performance.In another experiment participants were instructed to take a one-minute basket-shooting challenge, by a researcher who was wearing a T-shirt with a white skull on, along with other visual signifiers of mortality - displayed to only half of the participants.Those who had seen the "death" T-shirt performed about 30% better than those who had not.Study co-leader Colin Zestcott said: "Outside of sports, we think that this has implications for a range of different performance-related tasks, such as people's jobs."We're excited about the future of this research," said Zestcott.
