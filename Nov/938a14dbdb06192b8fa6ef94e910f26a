Nzimande died on Tuesday 22 November 2016. The country has lost one of the most celebrated and respected football legends that South Africa has ever produced. We convey our heartfelt condolences to the Nzimande family relatives and all in the football fraternity. May his soul rest in peace the President said.The presidency said Nzimande will be remembered for his terrific wizardry skills in the football field in the 1970s where he played as a defensive midfielder and a centre back for then newly formed Kaizer XI which was later named Kaizer Chiefs.Kaizer Chiefs said on its website that Nzimande was 69 when he died and had recently had a stroke from which he never recovered.Chiefs founder Kaizer Motaung who played alongside Nzimande said: "Words cannot express how distraught I felt upon hearing this news". I have known Ten-Ten since he joined Kaizer s XI in late 1969. He was not only a great teammate during the time that he played for Chiefs we were good friends as well. He was not a big talker but on the field he led with his actions. He was very strong and a player everybody looked up to." - TMG Digital
