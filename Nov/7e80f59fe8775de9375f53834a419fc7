The former Dutch national team goalkeeper has taken over from Roger de Sa and won a difficult point in his first match in charge away at Free State Stars.Now as Ajax begin to ponder the possibility of being sucked into a relegation dog fight Menzo says he is ready for the challenge. I like the pressure to win the pressure to have to win " he said."I lived with this pressure all my life as a player and as a coach. It s part of me. When I play football I want to win. Menzo has his work cut out for him with Ajax on just three points from their eight games.They have yet to win a game this seasons but this week had a morale boosting 6-1 victory over National First Division front-runners Stellenbosch.Their next league game is at home to Maritzburg United at home on Saturday November 19 and there will be six more games (three at home and three away) before Christmas. I enjoy being on the field working with players working with young footballers and trying to make them better."It s nice when they believe in what you practice with them and when it comes out in the matches."There is nothing nicer than winning being successful wining trophies. You really notice all of that when you are no longer winning."It s a feeling of something else when you are not winning. But Menzo believes Ajax can be back winning again. In football small things can change the momentum. There are many aspect of the game that make it unpredictable and that we can start to swing our way. - TMG Digital
