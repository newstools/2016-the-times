In case you've been living under a rock for the past week, pictures of Limpopo prophet Lethebo of Mount Zion General Assembly spraying Doom on members of his congregation went viral on Monday.The prophet and members of his congregation believed that the 'blessed' insect repellent, had healing powers, after he had prayed over it.Joining many who made fun a complete mockery out of this controversy is Somizi, who has just revealed that Doom can also 'cure' homosexuality.Taking to Instagram, the TV and radio personality posted a sidesplitting clip of himself introducing the pesticide as a "product that will not only change your life, but also change your sexuality".He's obviously joking. But it's hilarious nonetheless.A video posted by Somizi (@somizi) on Nov 22, 2016 at 5:17am PST
