The Du Toit experiment had merit but it failed in the sense that Du Toit was culpable of falling for two dummies by England scrumhalf Ben Youngs on the fringes of rucks last weekend. Both moments led to England tries which resulted in a 37-21 victory for the Roses at Twickenham which ended a 10-year 12-match winless streak against the Boks.It also carried England to their 10th win of 2016 in their 10th outing. Du Toit was naturally disappointed with those moments but Coetzee didn t hang him out to dry. Pieter is feeling okay mentally after that Coetzee said. He wasn t in that position because he was playing flank it was general attack by England and it could have been a prop there as well. It was a matter of role definition that he got wrong."It s a case of understanding role definition better but there were other defensive mistakes that led to those situations. The players have taken accountability for those errors and it won t happen again. Du Toit will shift back to the second row alongside Lood de Jager while it appears that Teboho Mohoje will return in the No 7 jersey. Willem Alberts who won the Boks internal man-of-the-match award after making a mammoth 25 tackles looks set to retain his place at openside for the Italy clash. Coetzee partly blamed the Boks porous defence on the fact that under new defence coach JP Ferreira they are up to their third coach in that area of the game this season. Jacques Nienaber did the job against Ireland in June and Chean Roux took over for the Rugby Championship.Ferreira on secondment from the Lions is the third in this most crucial of areas. We are into a third defence coach and JP Ferreira is also only in his third week with us so here and there defensive errors do creep in Coetzee said. The longer we settle on the system now it will improve. - TMG Digital
