 I was bowling (on Friday) and felt this pop or like a thud in my shoulder Steyn told Channel Nine in an interview broadcast before the start of play on the third day of the first test between Australia and South Africa at the WACA. There was a lot of pain and I had to go off the field. I went for an MRI and we ve got a clean fracture in one of the bones in my shoulder. It s not pretty. Steyn suffered a similar injury in December during South Africa s test series against England. But it wasn t as bad he said. That was a stress reaction a very hairline small little crack. This time it s more of a fracture; it s kind of broken the whole bone. I ll probably look to have surgery and put a plate in there and get the bone back together or something like that. We re probably looking at a minimum of six months. Steyn said he had come back too soon from the December injury. The last time it took about three months and I was up and running and able to play he said. But there s a lot of cricket to be played and people want you to play. I probably didn t have the full time to recover. I ve been dealing with this thing for quite some time now so I probably should have taken a little bit longer. But I was wanting to rush and get to the World T20 (in March). I wanted to go to the IPL (Indian Premier League). I ll probably have to take the time this time and let it heal properly. Steyn 33 needs five more wickets to become South Africa s leading test bowler.If he regains his fitness he could take them in South Africa s series in England which starts on July 6 next year.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
