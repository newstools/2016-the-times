On Friday Botswana, which spoke on behalf of the African Group, of which South Africa is a member, called for the suspension of the expert.The group, according to Lawyers for Human Rights, said sexual orientation and gender identity "are not and should not be linked to the existing international human rights instruments".The lawyers yesterday criticised South Africa for its apparent support of the African Group's calls.But, said Clayson Monyela, Department of International Relations and Co-operation spokesman, SA representatives walked out of a meeting when the calls were made."What Lawyers for Human Rights says is simply not true. Our ambassador walked out of the meeting because the calls are not something that we could associate ourselves with."
