Two vans packed with awaiting-trial prisoners from Pollsmoor, heading to courts in the city centre, routinely pass between two jammed lanes of peak-hour traffic with a siren-blaring police vehicle in the vanguard.Motorists tend to co-operate, even though it must be irritating to have to stop texting, shaving or applying make-up during the crepuscular crawl.After all, there's a genuine security issue here: a few years ago prisoners in one of the vans were sprung by armed accomplices.All the prison vans do to me, as a lane-splitting motorcyclist, is slow me down as I chug along in their wake. And that's OK. I learnt long ago that frustration is a motorcyclist's second-worst enemy (after texters).So I surprised myself yesterday when a suspected criminal in a blue-light convoy got under my skin.President Jacob Zuma had welcomed Chinese Vice-President Li Yuanchao to Genadendal on Tuesday evening, and was clearly in a hurry to get to Tuynhuis when his convoy absorbed me as it barged into the traffic.My Kawasaki was out of place amid the black 4x4s, if I correctly interpreted the hand signals aimed at me from various passenger windows in the phallic phalanx of around 10 vehicles.But my instinctive reaction in declining to get out of the way revealed that I didn't care.Why should this discredited man, this man who has violated his oath of office and disregarded the constitution he swore to uphold, bully me, one of his funders?Why should the burgeoning battalion of bodyguards with which Number One (recently promoted to #JZ783) sees fit to surround himself interfere with the tranquillity of my journey to the office where I will spend more than half my day working for the fiscus?Who needs 10 vehicles to get to the office anyway, when the rest of us find that one generally does the trick?As Hospital Bend unwound in front of me and I was able to pass the testosterone-fuelled protectors (losers!), the blur of thoughts crystallised.What if drivers across the country, collectively, chose not to move aside for Zuma? After all, he won't move aside for us.Imagine the sweet satisfaction of landing him in a jam after he's spent years doing the same to South Africa. After spending so long hoping to see him in the rear-view mirror, here's a chance to make it happen.Admittedly, there would be risks that might be unpalatable to the lift-pooling mom with a posse of Grade 1s on board; the presidential posse are armed with Ray-Bans and Uzis.But if we united in this simple form of passive resistance to a president who has lost legitimacy in the eyes of all but a few slavering lickspittles, what could they do?It's time to let Zuma know he's on the road to nowhere.
