Deputy director-general Seipati Dlamini was previously employed in the Free State department of agriculture as a financial officer and had allegedly made an irregular payment to a Gupta-linked dairy venture in the province.Zwane was present at the meeting of Parliament s mineral resources committee on Wednesday at which the letter addressed to him by DA mineral resources spokesman James Lorimer through the committee was discussed.Lorimer questioned what seemed to be the deeply concerning "irregular appointment".He said it appeared that Zwane had not followed due process in making the appointment and stressed that the committee as an oversight committee had to fulfil its obligations of oversight of the executive.But ANC MPs wanted the minister to be given the opportunity to reply in writing to Lorimer s request rather than reply immediately.Lorimer asked that the minister be summoned to explain the appointment especially in the light of the cloud of scandals surrounding the minister and his links to the Guptas.The minister was given Lorimer s letter and asked to respond at the next committee meeting. Zwane said he would deal with the letter "appropriately".He said he did not need to be summoned to appear before the committee as he was always willing to be present.- TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
