The round finished in near darkness after one hour and 40 minutes were lost due to a lightning warning.When play resumed the Swede charged down the back nine with five birdies to card a 67 to be eight under for the tournament.He grabbed the lead on the 17th after earlier pacesetter Fabrizio Zanotti bogeyed the same hole.Zanotti also bogeyed the last to fall two shots behind.Noren's only blemish came when he bogeyed the par-three 12th but the rest of his back nine was impressive.He holds a two-shot lead over Zanotti Louis Oosthuizen George Coetzee Chris Wood and Jaco van Zyl.Oosthuizen played himself into contention with an impressive 66 the lowest round of the day.There were times when he had to second guess himself. A few times I had to change my mind."You'd stand over it (the ball) and the wind would die down."Especially up here where the ball travels further you don't want to be with a stronger club in your hand. Early in the round Zanotti created history when he recorded the tournament's first ever hole-in-one.The Paraguayan who had made a flying start with birdies on the 1st and the 2nd gained two more shots to par when he hit an inch perfect seven iron on the 195m fourth.His ball returned to terra firma around 20 yards from the flag but rolled inexorably towards and into the hole.He raised his arms and in delight let go of his club when the ball disappeared into the cup thus becoming the first man to watch his tee shot disappear in that fashion in the 35-year history of the tournament.Later in the day Denmark's Lasse Jensen recorded an albatross on the par five 14th.Going for the green in two he cleared the surrounding bunker as his ball bounced on the fringe of the green and rolled at some speed into the hole.Tournament favourite Henrik Stenson had an indifferent day.He bogeyed holes three four and five and went on to double bogey the 14th.He is seven shots off the lead. - TMG Digital
