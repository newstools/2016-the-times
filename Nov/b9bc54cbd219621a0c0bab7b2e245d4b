The surgery Dale Steyn needed to repair his broken shoulder has been a success, South Africa s team management said on Sunday.Steyn was ruled out of the tour of Australia after breaking down on the second day of the first test at the WACA on November 4. Dale had successful surgery on Thursday where the fracture in the right shoulder blade was fixated with the placement of a screw, a Cricket South Africa release quoted team manager Mohammed Moosajee as saying. We expect a minimum six-month rehabilitation period before he can start any form of bowling. It is crucial to give the injury enough time to heal and to make sure that he is completely pain-free before he starts bowling again. He will begin with his rehabilitation programme once the satisfactory bony healing has taken place; this is excepted to be in a few weeks. We are positive that he will make a successful return to international cricket. He will be provided with the best possible support and guidance led by our physiotherapist, Brandon Jackson, and Cricket South Africa s medical committee, which will give him the best opportunity to make a successful return to full fitness. The injury is the 33-year-old fast bowler s third major setback since last November.Groin and shoulder problems kept Steyn out of six of the eight tests South Africa played last season.
