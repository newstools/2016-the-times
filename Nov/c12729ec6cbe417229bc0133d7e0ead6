During an interview with Anele Mdoda on Real Talk recently, Fikile opened up about cheating on his wife with model, Joyce Omphemetse Molamu.He labelled his brief tryst with Joyce as "a one-night stand," adding that he regrets it."This thing was a one-night stand, and it happened just like that. It so happens that I regret that," he explained.In response to these comments, a furious Ntsiki lashed out Fikile.This "thing" sies this man is soooooo disgusting. Why is he even in government. He is a stupid buffoon. https://t.co/KaOWNdneSl This THING likes to sleep around. ....sfebe https://t.co/KaOWNdneSlIt was only after receiving Gwede Mantashe's advice that Fikile decided to own up to his actions and apologise. He claimed he bought his wife a diamond to say sorry. "If your man bought u a diamond ring every time he cheated then u would be blinging outside but broken inside," wrote Ntsiki during her rant."It's not about the ring.....its about TRUST," she added.The office of the minister has said that he will not be commenting on Ntsiki's tweets."Oh, Ntsiki? No response," said media liaison officer Esethu Hasane.
