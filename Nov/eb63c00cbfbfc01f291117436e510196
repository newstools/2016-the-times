City will host Maritzburg United in the league this coming Tuesday before entertaining Free State Stars in the Telkom Knockout semifinals next Saturday afternoon.Both games were originally scheduled for the more plush Cape Town Stadium City s regular home but the club has confirmed they have been forced to move. Our next two home games will be played at Athlone Stadium due to pitch maintenance issues and scheduling conflicts at Cape Town Stadium City said in a statement. Athlone [Stadium] has stepped in to assist us and this helped us keep our next two home games in Cape Town and most importantly it will allow us to have a Cape Town semifnal. This will be the first time that City have played a home game away from their Cape Town Stadium base where the excellent pitch has allowed them to use the likes of Lebogang Manyama and Aubrey Ngoma as key attacking weapons.Eric Tinkler s side are next away at Chippa United on Saturday where victory could take them to the top of the PSL standings if other results go their way.
