This comes after her name was submitted to the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) as the ANC candidate in the 2016 municipal elections without the support of the ward.In June the ANC said it was investigating fraud after the name of the selected candidate Thando Pimpi was replaced with Mquqwana. In the run-up to election day ANC provincial leaders begged people to vote for Mquqwana with the promise that she would resign the day after elections.The ANC won the ward with a resounding 83% (though this was down from 92% in the previous election and 97% in 2000). The EFF had fewer than 7% and the DA slightly more than 5% of the votes).But according to ANC members in the ward Mquqwana has made it very clear to the ANC that she has no intention of resigning.Mquqwana told GroundUp she had "no comment".On Thursday ANC Provincial Executive Committee Western Cape Head of Communication Jabu Mfusi told GroundUp the ANC was busy begging Mquqwana to resign as a ward councillor. Pimpi would stand in a by-election. Disciplinary hearing will be the last thing. For now we are still asking her nicely to do the right thing and resign he said.ANC members in the ward told GroundUp the ANC provincial structure was failing them dismally.One member who asked not to be named said members had given the provincial structure one month to solve the matter. If they fail residents will go back to the streets as they did previously. We are tired of their empty promises. As members we do not recognise Mquqwana as our ward councillor. We are working with Pimpi because we elected him to be our ward councillor he said.ANC councillors in other parts of the country are also refusing to resign. Earlier this month GroundUp reported on two such wards in the Eastern Cape.
