Habana 33 arrived in London with a knee niggle on Monday and head coach Allister Coetzee wasn t positive that he would play in the crucial match But after Tuesday s training session behind closed doors at the Latymer Upper School Grounds in northwest London assistant coach Matt Proudfoot declared Habana ready. He participated in full training today Proudfoot said. We have a full squad to choose from. It s a boost for the Boks if the 123-Test veteran is available for selection considering the importance of the match.When it comes to clashes against northern hemisphere opposition England are the Boks fiercest rival even if they have not won in a decade.There is understandable optimism emanating from camp England after winning all nine of their Tests in 2016 under coach Eddie Jones.Having Habana in the back three alongside JP Pietersen and perhaps fullback Willie le Roux would add much needed experience in a crucial part of the pitch.The trio have a combined 231 Test caps.Coetzee made no secret that he believed England would launch an aerial assault on the Boks at Twickenham on Saturday.The experienced trio would boost that area of the Boks game especially as rain is predicted.Le Roux is mercurial but when he is on song he is superb under the high ball while Lions wing Ruan Combrinck is also able to play fullback and could be another option. - TMG Digital
