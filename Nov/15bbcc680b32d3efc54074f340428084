This is the advice of a Good Samaritan who helped a woman who had been allegedly chucked out of a moving car by her husband on the N12 between Johannesburg and Boksburg on Friday.Samaritan Pamela Green was let down by the police's 10111 number and cellphone network provider MTN's emergency service line - with the fourth agent hanging up on her.Green, founder of Second Chances, a social change movement, was driving home at about 11pm when the incident occurred."[The woman's] limp body had tumbled down the grass embankment and landed in a heap in the emergency lane," Green said on her Facebook page.Green called the police's emergency line and gave her location but was told to dial 112, MTN's emergency line. After being put through four agents, and 30 minutes later, no help had arrived."And then an absolute angel appeared out of nowhere . Lundi [Mhlana], a private security guard," she said.Mhlana, of Tsolo in Eastern Cape, said he stopped when he saw the two women, one of whom was injured: "I had to stop, it is my job. I help many ladies at night with flat tyres or breakdowns. I stay with them till help arrives."Mhlana, 33, helped Green to get the 33-year-old Boksburg mother of two into her car so they could drive to the nearest police station.While driving, Green tried again to get hold of the police. When she was told there was no record of the call, she became furious and was put through to a captain, who immediately sent help."The woman was taken to hospital with bruises and a broken leg," Green said. She is still in hospital.MTN's Ideshini Naidoo said the call had been transferred via its emergency services when it got cut off: "Investigations are continuing to probe the purported conduct of the call centre agent at emergency services where the call was transferred."
