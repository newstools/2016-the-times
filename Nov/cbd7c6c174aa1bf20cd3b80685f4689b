The group wants to challenge the UK government's mass interception programme, and its access to US surveillance programmes after being surveilled illegally.According to a submission made to the European court, the centre's e-mail account was illegally intercepted by the UK government, but the organisation has yet to establish the motives.Janet Love, national director of the LRC in South Africa, said the case before the court was a key opportunity for an international standard to be set on mass surveillance as the outcome of the case would be legally binding."For too long state agencies have been permitted to operate under a pernicious veil of secrecy in a manner that has violated the rights to dignity and privacy of innumerable people across the world," she said.The co-applicants include human rights NGOs based in the UK and abroad, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Bytes for All, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, among others.The Right2Know campaign has shed light on what it calls intelligence scandals in South Africa, where journalists, activists and unions have had their cellphones tapped and movements monitored.A report titled "Surveillance and Democracy: Chilling Tales from Around the World" was launched at Constitution Hill this week, attempting to expose the truth about unrestrained surveillance.
