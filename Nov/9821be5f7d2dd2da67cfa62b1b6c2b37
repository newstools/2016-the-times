Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and party treasurer Zweli Mkhize are set to become the latest targets in the state capture saga.The three are being investigated for failing to report Jonas s sensational claim that one of the Gupta brothers, Ajay, offered him a R600-million bribe and the finance minister post.The move is seen as part of a fightback strategy by President Jacob Zuma s supporters, who are resisting growing calls for the president to step down following the release of the damning State of Capture report.The latest revelation comes as Zuma this week told the ANC top six he will NOT resign.For more on this story and other details on state capture developments, read the Sunday Times today.
