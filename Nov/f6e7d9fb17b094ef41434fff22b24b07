McBride was expected to to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate s Court on allegations that he doctored an Ipid report that cleared top Hawks officials on allegations of unlawful renditions.McBride denied the charge saying he was being targeted because of high-level investigations he and his office were conducting. NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku confirmed on Tuesday that charges have been withdrawn."The charges have been withdrawn after consultation with witnesses the state would be unable to prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt " said Mfaku.McBride has welcomed the decision.Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said on Tuesday McBride knew from the beginning that there was never a case for him to answer. "He is very pleased that the case has been withdrawn but he had always believed that there was never a case against him. It shows that it was malicious and the prosecution was an attack on the independence of Ipid "" said Dlamini. - TMG Digital
