The latest figures from 2011 show that just 5% of graduates are without jobs. But the good times are likely to grind to a halt, especially as the government reduces the number of public-service posts.This bodes badly for black graduates especially, who are most likely to be hired by the government.A British Council report that looked into higher education in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana noted that this country's black graduates struggled to find work and were more likely to go for government jobs which were declining.The Universities, Employability and Inclusive Development report stated: "While white graduates have increasingly obtained employment in the private sector, black graduates have increasingly obtained posts in the public sector."It found that white and Indian graduates were more likely to be employed before black and coloured graduates.The report said evidence showed that graduates from former black institutions took longer to be absorbed into the labour market, whereas graduates from former white universities were absorbed more quickly."Poor students who attend lesser-known universities . struggle to get jobs. Employers recruit from a small range of universities even though they claim to value diversity in the workplace."The report noted that though "there is no obvious graduate unemployment challenge now, this may change as more graduates complete their studies and fewer opportunities become available in the state sector."Despite the need for people with technical skills, students from universities of technology were more likely to be unemployed.The report said employers complained that most graduates seemed to know a lot of theory, but not how to apply it.It cited another study that found a huge mismatch between what bosses want and what they got from hiring university graduates.Annelize van Rensburg of the Talent Africa recruitment agency said when employing graduates companies looked for involvement in communities and references from holiday jobs."Graduates very seldom have experience in specifics, but having kept a holiday or weekend job shows commitment and drive."The report recommended more engagement and collaboration between universities and employers.The report reiterated the demands of #FeesMustFall students, who have asked for more funds from the government.South Africa spends 0.72% of its GDP on universities. It noted that it spent less of its budget in 2016 on university education compared with what was spent in 2011.
