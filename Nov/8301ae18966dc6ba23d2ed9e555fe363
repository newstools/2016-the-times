Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba believes the policeman was speeding in a residential area while his political bosses were out of town.Mashaba said his friend, Solly Moutlana, 59, would have survived if the driver had not been speeding."The accident happened in a 60km/h zone. If the vehicle was travelling at that speed or below, he would have survived," he said.On Saturday, Mashaba, tweeted: "I have just received the terrible news that President Zuma's blue lights brigades killed a friend Solly Moutlana yesterday."But the Presidency said President Jacob Zuma was in East London for the National Council of Provinces' Taking Parliament to the People event.His spokesman, Bongani Ngqulunga, said it was "unfortunate" that Mashaba's tweet created the impression that Zuma's convoy killed Moutlana.Mashaba later clarified that the member of the police VIP unit assigned to Zuma was driving alone.Ngqulunga said: "I do not know why mayor Mashaba is politicising the incident."Police confirmed that Moutlana, from Mamelodi, was hit on Pretorius Street, in Hatfield, on Friday. He died at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital hours later.Brigadier Mashadi Selepe said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated.
