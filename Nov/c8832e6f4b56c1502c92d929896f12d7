During the live broadcast of the New Age business briefing on 27 October, the Motsoeneng alleged that Mthembu had attempted to 'capture' him.Mthembu's legal representatives sent a letter to Motsoeneng demanding an immediate public apology and retraction for his defamatory claims, according to a statement released by the chief whip's office.The letter further demanded that Motsoeneng disclose all the details of the alleged meeting where such attempted capture allegedly took placed or face court action."There is no doubt that Motsoeneng s claims are unfounded, unsubstantiated and blatantly false. The made-up accusations, aired publicly on live television, were intended to impugn the character of the chief whip."Imputing improper motives on the chief whip was clearly designed to threaten and blackmail him and the ANC in Parliament into silence on a matter of principle with the hope that the inquiry into the SABC, which the ANC caucus has outspokenly pursued, would be abandoned," the statement reads.In his court papers, Mthembu is asking the court to order Motsoeneng to:- Pay a sum of R1,000,000;- Issue unconditional public apology for the injury caused to the Chief Whip as a result of the defamatory statement, both in print and over a public broadcast, within seven days of the date of judgment; and- Pay the legal costs.
