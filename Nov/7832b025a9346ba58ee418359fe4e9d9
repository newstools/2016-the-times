While football thrives on unpredictability, the 6-1 shellacking Baxter's side handed Orlando Pirates in the November 1 league clash is not going to happen again.As good as Supersport were on the night, a combination of factors that went in their favour may not avail themselves tomorrow when the sides meet in the second Telkom Knockout Cup semi-final at the Mbombela Stadium.Actually, getting his team to jump off that high horse is Baxter's hardest task."Any game that has taken place in the past is totally irrelevant now. I've seen results all over the world where you see Manchester United losing to MK Dons but that doesn't make the MK Dons the favourites. Even if this game is not on the same level, you can't be relying on history, and like the Titanic sinking all those years ago, that's in the past."We'll get on with our lives and the same applies to football matches," Baxter said."We're going to have to play very well if we want to win this time because Pirates will always be a formidable team."It's going to be an away game for us in Mbombela because we also enjoyed playing there."When we won that game, it rained quite heavily and we were able to play a specific game and Pirates didn't adapt. I don't think that'll be the same case this time. The team that wins will have to play very well."Pirates' caretaker coach, Augusto Palacios, was not part of the massacre and that could be a good thing for the team. However, he ruled out talk of revenge:"It's just another game and no one is talking about revenge. We just need to have this winning mentality we are starting to foster."
