Mashaba was told to stay at home after a verbal altercation with Safa president Danny Jordaan and guests who had arrived at the team's changing room after the 2-1 World Cup qualifier victory over Senegal in Polokwane on Saturday.The side will instead be led by assistant coach Owen da Gama and is likely to see a number of changes, including a debut for Dutch-born striker Lars Veldwijk, who was on the bench on Saturday.The Senegal victory extended Bafana's unbeaten run to 13 matches, just two short of their all-time longest unbeaten run of 15.The last time Mashaba saw his side lose was the 3-1 defeat away in Mauritania in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in September last year.Since a loss to Angola in the African Nations Championship qualifiers in October last year, Bafana have won eight and drawn five of their 13 games.But all these records will mean little to the players, especially to Veldwijk, who are instead trying to position themselves in the team for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers that begin in March and the continuation of the World Cup qualifiers in August.Mozambique are going through a rebuilding phase under flamboyant former Portugal international Abel Xavier.Their latest defeat came in a 1-0 friendly loss to Kenya in Nairobi at the weekend, making that four losses in their last five games.Bafana have won all five of their previous meetings with Mozambique, scoring 13 goals and conceding three in the process.
