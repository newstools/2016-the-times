The South Africans trained in a steady rain in their final session on the perfect beautifully green pitch at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Friday morning.By the afternoon when Senegal ran out the weather had cleared.Most of Senegal s players are based in Europe so will be used to far more adverse weather conditions than what Polokwane has to offer.And of course it rains in the west African country.But cool overcast conditions and even a bit of rain might suit 62nd-ranked Bafana s quick-passing high tempo game they will surely try to employ against the 32nd-ranked Lions of Teranga.Mashaba said he was impressed at how his players trained on the wet surface on Friday.Such minor factors might seem incidental but in a match that seems bound to be settled by the narrowest of margins every bit just might count. The rain that came this morning was a blessing in disguise Mashaba said. It was preparing our boys. After the session I told them it was the first time in my life I had seen our players playing so well under the rain. They were buzzing playing one touch and two touch and took shots as well. We re waiting for the game tomorrow I think we ll put smiles on people s faces. Bafana have been warmly received in Polokwane with everyone they meet offering their support for a big game.The director for sports development for Limpopo Junior Ramusi said: The people of Limpopo received the national team well at Polokwane International Airport. There was a reception by supporters and the provincial government put weight behind welcoming Bafana we had the MEC for Sport the executive mayor of Polokwane and the executive mayor of the Capricorn district. On Friday the team went to the Mall of the North where thousands of people came to greet them. One also cannot ignore the elephant in the room though.This game might not just have the potential to make or break the coming years fortunes of two underachieving national teams.It could also decide the continuity of the latest and surely final Bafana tenure of Mashaba.Both SA Football Association (Safa) CEO Dennis Mumble and president Danny Jordaan have travelled to Polokwane in support of the team.Should Bafana lose so soon after a failure to reach the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations and put themselves in an almost impossible situation in Group D the Safa bosses will be on hand to dish out swift action should they feel it is required.Senegal have the stronger team on paper.They went through the Afcon 2017 qualifiers with a 100 percent record with six wins from six and are the favourites.Bafana have been buoyed by Mamelodi Sundowns confidence-boosting Caf Champions League victory Mashaba has some real talent at his disposal they have home advantage and the feeling that perhaps South African football is on the cusp of something special.That the tide of history might just have finally turned for SA football.This will be a nail-biter.- TMG Digital
