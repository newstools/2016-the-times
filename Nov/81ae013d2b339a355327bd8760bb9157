Pacquiao, who turns 38 next month, floored Vargas in the second round en route to a one-sided win, allowing him to reclaim the WBO welterweight title both he and Mayweather had held previously.It is a title that Pacquiao surrendered when he lost last year to Mayweather in the richest fight in boxing history.The retired Mayweather's appearance at ringside on Saturday, at Pacquiao's request, will certainly stir talk of a rematch."Yes, I invited him to come tonight," Pacquiao said of Mayweather.Asked if he wanted a rematch with Mayweather, Pacquiao said: "We will see."Pacquiao beat Vargas with a unanimous decision to capture the WBO belt for the third time.As with previous fights, the match was broadcast on big screens in malls so the public could see Pacquiao in action.After the fight, Vargas was asked if he wanted to see Pacquiao and Mayweather go at it again."Of course," Vargas said.But both Pacquiao and promoter Bob Arum were noncommittal about a second fight with Mayweather."As far as we're concerned he's retired and we respect that," Arum said after the fight.Pacquiao skipped the post-fight conference because he needed 16 stitches to repair a cut from a head butt.
