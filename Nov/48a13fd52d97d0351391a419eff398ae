Onyango has not played since suffering concussion after receiving an early knock in the head during the African Champions League final second leg tie last month.He traveled home to Uganda last week for World Cup action but doctors in his home country agreed with Sundowns that he sit out the match as he was still not over the affects of the bang on the head.It means there is still concern about the knock he received after colliding with Zamalek s Stanley Ohawuchi in the opening exchanges of the final in Alexandria where Sundowns were crowned continental champions.But at the same time as Onyango was watching Uganda beat Congo 1-0 to remain unbeaten in World Cup qualification his Sundowns back-up Kennedy Mweene was performing heroics for Zambia.The 31-year-old Mweene made a series of key saves to ensure a vital away point for Zambia at Cameroon after they had been beaten at home by Nigeria in October.The 1-1 tie in Limbe means Zambia s World Cup hopes are resurrected.Mweene has been in goal for Sundowns in the four matches they have played since Onyango s injury with Wayne Sandilands on the bench.He has conceded two goals both in the surprise league loss to Cape Town City.Mweene is fast approaching 300 starts in the PSL since debuting at Free State Stars. He sits on 294.Sandilands 33 has only had the one run out for the club this season but with 215 PSL appearances to his name is also a more than comfortable option for Mosimane.- TMG Digital
