Masuluke - up for a corner in the final seconds of added time on Wednesday night - received a looping half-clearance from the corner by Pirates' goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane just inside the area with his back to goal, and produced a 17-metre overhead kick that will take social media by storm in coming days, not just in South Africa but surely globally.The 96th-minute winner was one of those rare and randomly unexplainable moments of brilliance and magic rarely seen on a football field. An occasion of inpiration that only the football gods, or perhaps a momentary anomaly in the alignment of the planets at that particular milisecond that Masuluke decided through pure instinct to do what he did, could possibly account for.It robbed Pirates of what would have been a somewhat fortunate third victory in succession under caretaker-coach Augusto Palacios.Defender Justice Chabalala s 48-minute goal from a corner came against the tone of the match, where a disjointed Bucs were shaded by the First Division champions from Polokwane.Most of the action in the first half came in the early exchanges, and much of it the way of Baroka s nippy, quick attack.In the seventh minute Marshall Munetsi was played through but dispossessed by Justice Chabalala s challenge, with Geoffrey Massa striking the loose ball to force a save from Jackson Mabokgwane.Absolutely unreal scenes as Baroka FC's goalkeeper scores 95th minute overhead-kick! pic.twitter.com/XXQ96AHVCvAt the other end the ever-hungry Tendai Ndoro rounded big Baroka keeper Oscarine Masuluke but steered an attempted finish from a tight angle into the side-netting.In the 25 Baroka midfielder Rithabile Soso s drive came within a few feet.Bucs stepped things up in attack from the break.From Oupa Manyisa s corner Chabalala was able to get a foot in at the far post and bury a close-range volley for the former Free State Stars centreback s first goal for Pirates.Again, Baroka, though, edged control with impressive left-back Tshepiso Lietsisa s cross-cum-shot having to be palmed over by Mabokgwane.Then came the beautiful, perplexing and amazing moment from Masuluke.Also last night:Free State Stars 3 Platinum Stars 1Lamontville Golden Arrows 3 Polokwane City 3
