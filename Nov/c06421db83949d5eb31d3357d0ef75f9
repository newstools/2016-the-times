The ANCYL's national executive committee has sent a stern warning to its KwaZulu-Natal province after secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo allegedly referred to the ANC's Eastern Cape and Gauteng provinces as a "bunch of losers". Sabelo threw AU Commission chairman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's name in the ring as a suitable candidate to replace President Jacob Zuma for good measure as well.This did not sit well with the ANCYL. National spokesman Mlondi Mkhize said the the youth league would engage with Sabelo over his remarks. "We have now sent letters to all provinces in relation to the matter of the 2017 conference. We do not expect any province to pronounce before the national structure pronounces," Mkhize said.Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni said: "The league is not the same any more. It now has positioned itself to defend a faction of the current leadership. Theirrecent moves are just to neutralise their opponents."Mkhize said the appointment of task teams in Eastern Cape and Gauteng was part of strengthening the organisation ahead of its NEC meeting next month, when the contents of the ANCYL's discussion document for the policy conference in June next year will be decided.
