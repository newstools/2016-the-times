Interim coach Augusto Palacios, who famously led Pirates to the league title in 2011/12 while also in charge on a temporary basis, the same season they won the 16-team cup competition for the one and only time, steered the Buccaneers ship out of rough seas as he enjoyed a winning start to his Pirates reign.It was Palacios first match in charge of the Buccanners following his midweek instalment as interim coach to replace Muhsin Ertugral, who resigned a day after overseeing a club record-equalling 6-1 League defeat at the hands of SuperSport United in Nelspruit. A Tendai Ndoro strike five minutes before the half time break and an own goal from his Zimbabwean countryman Augustine Mbara early in the second half were enough to put the Buccaneers through to the semi final, with Mothobi Mvala netting for the visitors.It was the Lions of the North who got out of their blocks first and could have gone in front as early as the third minute. Mvala got at the end of a corner kick and headed powerfully towards goal only for Pirates skipper Oupa Manyisa to clear the ball off the goal line.Thanduyise Khuboni threatened the Pirates goal with a dipping long range shortly after but goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo did well as he tipped the ball over the cross bar.The Buccaneers should have opened the scoring in the 27th minute when right back Thembela Sikhakhane found Ndoro with a long diagonal pass. The striker controlled the ball well before delivering a pin point cross for Luvuyo Memela, who could only glance his header inches wide of target with only keeper Tapuwa Kapini to beat.Collins Mbesuma should have put the visitors ahead at the other end after he found some space inside the box but his header went narrowly over the cross bar as Pirates showed their frailties in dealing with the long balls into their own box.Memela also had an opportunity to open the scoring but failed to compose himself as he combined well with Thabo Rakhale and Ndoro going forward, albeit lacking that final killer touch in the final third.With five minutes to the half time break, right back Sikhakhane was brought down by Franklin Cale near the edge of the box on the right side and referee Phillip Tinyane whistled for a foul and flashed a yellow card.Pirates went in front from the resultant free kick. Memela delivered a telling free kick into the box, which Highlands defender Augustine Mbara headed into his own box as the Buccaneers went into the break with their tails up.The second half started on a rather pedestrian pace as both sides tried to find their composure where and when it mattered the most.But Pirates soon found their rhythm and started to ask tough questions of the Highlands defence with Rakhale, Ndoro, Memela and Mpho Makola looking in the mood.Pirates doubled their lead with half an hour remaining following a fantastic team move. The Highlands defenders were caught napping when Rakhale took a quick short free kick to Makola, who crossed it to Ndoro for an easy tap in.Mvala pulled one back six minutes and, although Highlands staged a late rally to take the match into extra time, luck was just not on their side as they missed chance after chance.Gordon Igesund, who began his tenure as Highlands Park coach with a win to knock out Chippa United in the last round, looked agitated on the bench throughout the match and will probably feel his team were the better side on the night and deserved something in the match.Pirates join SuperSport United and Cape Town City in the last four. United beat Mamelodi Sundowns 3-1 in a penalty shoot-out at the Lucas Moripe Stadium while City triumphed 4-3 away at Baroka.They will be joined by Sunday s winner between Free State Stars and Kaizer Chiefs. - TMG Digital
