Phosa tore into Abrahams after his public decision not to prosecute Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan saying that the head of prosecutions lacked moral fibre.The former ANC treasurer general said Abrahams should have informed the nation I m stepping down. I have embarrassed the country. The country lost billions of rands because of me it was a stupid decision. Abrahams has now responded in an interview with Eyewitness News arguing that complaints about him that were sent to the General Council of the Bar by the EFF and Phosa are unfounded. I am more than fit and proper to hold this position. I am more than fit and proper to be a member of the advocates' profession he said. Addressing criticism against him by the EFF he said: Of course the NPA has decided to prosecute the leader of the EFF and I think we must look at it in that light. It s coming from politicians. Phosa wants the General Council of the Bar to investigate whether Abrahams is a fit and proper person to lead the country s prosecution service. Mr Phosa had contacted me a few weeks ago. I find it strange that he has now approached the Bar Council to investigate me said Abrahams. But he added he believed that nobody including himself was above the law and said any investigation against him should be conducted if there was merit. Abrahams described himself as a career prosecutor.He took the job as head of the NPA because I felt that I had the credentials and I still feel that I have the credentials and ability to make a massive difference and change the face of justice for the betterment of all South Africans going forward .
