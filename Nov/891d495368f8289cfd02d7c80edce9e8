The DA contends that the minister is in breach of the duties assigned to him by the Executive Ethics Code.Section 2 of the Executive Ethics Act forbids Cabinet members deputy ministers and MECs from exposing themselves to any situation involving the risk of a conflict between their official responsibilities and their private interests; (iv) using their position or any information entrusted to them to enrich themselves or improperly benefit any other person; and (v) acting in a way that may compromise the credibility or integrity of their office or of the government .As is stipulated by the Act the complaint will be laid with the Public Protector Adv Busisiwe Mkhwebane DA spokesman on police matters Zakhele Mbhele said on Sunday. The DA has been aware of allegations that minister Nhleko abused his position of office to improperly benefit his girlfriend s non-profit organisation Indoni. In October the DA submitted a Parliamentary question to probe the details of a contract for the implementation of the We Are One Humanity Anti-Xenophobia campaign and to obtain details of financial transactions between the police ministry and Indoni SA Mbhele said.The reply from Nhleko was deliberately vague he charged. It has always seemed odd that an anti-xenophobia campaign to promote social cohesion was done through the police ministry rather than through or at least in partnership with the arts &amp; culture portfolio. In light of revelations today the minister s evasive reply seems more and more to have been an attempt to play for time and stall making these details known to us. It has now been more than a month since we submitted the question and Nhleko must now urgently provide the answers to our questions. In the absence of clear accountability the police ministry's relationship with Indoni SA will continue to be viewed as suspicious and will lend credence to the suggestion that the Minister is allowing the bedroom to influence his boardroom decisions Mbhele asserted.
