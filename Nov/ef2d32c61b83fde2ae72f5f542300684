Speaking to thousands of supporters at the party's victory rally in eDumbe KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday Zuma said he is not threatened by political parties who approach courts to scare him."People think democracy is done at courts. They never mention the will of the majority they always talk about courts. They never even speak to us about democratic debates because they know we are good at debates. They think by going to courts they are intimidating the ANC. We are not going to be intimidated even if it means I get arrested today I am used to it. I have spent a lot of time in jail you cannot threaten me with jail time .I am not scared of jail I have been there " Zuma said to loud cheers from the crowd.The Democratic Alliance won a court application to review the dropping of a corruption case against Zuma in the High Court.The party will once again lay corruption charges against Zuma following the release of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's Sate of Capture report."This next week will be the moment of reckoning for our country. We have to speak out against this attack on our Constitution and our democracy and fire Jacob Zuma immediately " DA leader Mmusi Maimane said in a statement.Zuma said opposition parties who approach courts on political matters are misrepresenting democracy. People who can t argue democratically always rely on courts. They love courts so much. That s misrepresentation of democracy. We must debate issues " Zuma said.The president was in eDumbe to thank voters for their support in the local government elections which took place in August.His address marked his first public appearance in the country since the State of Capture report was released on Wednesday.Zuma did not address allegations made against him in the report.
