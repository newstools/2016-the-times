Makhaye died in 2004 of cancer.His wife, Linda Makhaye, said yesterday that the family was happy her late husband had been recognised for the role he played in eradicating informal settlements.Tonight, Makhaye will receive a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award from human settlements minister Lindiwe Sisulu at the Govan Mbeki Awards at the Durban International Convention Centre."He was passionate about delivering housing to the people. His plans were that by 2015 all shacks would no longer be there. He had left everything written down and he had left it over to his predecessors to take over. He must be very happy," said Linda.Makhaye will be honoured along with Anna Tibaijuka, former executive director of the United Nation's Human Settlements Programme, who urged international cooperation to improve the quality of life of people everywhere.During a visit to the Cornubia development, we were told it could accommodate 28000 50m double-storey attached housing units and 120000 people upon completion.The 1300ha 20-year project, which started in 2012, is located north of Durban and is bordered by the N2 Freeway and M41 arterial road 7km south of the King Shaka International Airport.

Planning for a second phase, expected to deliver 2180 houses, is under way, with construction expected to start next year.The development will include schools, sports fields, clinics, swimming pools, libraries and community halls. The temporary Solomon Mahlangu Primary School opened in July lst year and accommodates 800 pupils. A permanent school design has been completed and tender documents prepared.It was announced yesterday that the R1.5-billion Investec Cornubia Mall will open in October 2017.Another high-profile project in the pipeline is the proposed Athletes Village for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, which will be built on land owned by the eThekwini municipality to accommodate 6000 athletes and officials.
