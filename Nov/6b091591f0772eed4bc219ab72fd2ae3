The New Zealanders are bound to bounce back and the team that will feel the backlash is Italy. An All Blacks win seems a formality.The touring Springboks drew 31-31 with a makeshift Barbarians team last weekend and, again, a clear style of rugby was not seen from the South Africans. They will have to find a consistent game-plan if they are to beat Eddie Jones's England, who are unbeaten in nine.The Boks have a great record at Twickenham, where they enjoy great support from expats.But I cannot see them winning.I predict the All Blacks to win by the proverbial mile and England to do the same, but by a tighter margin.
