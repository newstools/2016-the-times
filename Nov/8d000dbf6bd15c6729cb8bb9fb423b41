Mayor Herman Mashaba confirmed in an interview with eNCA that the search had been suspended but said it would continue on Friday.The girl was pulled from her father Shadrick Chauke's arms as he tried to get them to safety.Earlier Chauke told TMG Digital that the branch he was holding onto snapped when his child slipped from his grasp and disappeared as torrential rain engulfed his shack on the Jukskei River near Alexandra in northern Johannesburg.Mashaba said that with rain continuing the city's emergency response team was keeping a close eye on Alexandra. He said he had also received reports of potentially dangerous conditions at Nelspruit if more rains fell in that area.The mayor spent several hours in Alexandra on Thursday and said he was struck by the scale of the devastation. "At least 100 shacks were destroyed and over 300 people were affected."The homeless were being housed in community halls and churches as well as some tents the city had been able to erect before the rain began again. He said the rest of the tents would be put up on Friday.The long-term solution said Mashaba was to work with the private sector to kick-start large scale low-cost housing development in the Johannesburg city centre to give people like those currently living along the banks of the Jukskei safe affordable accommodation. - TMG Digital
