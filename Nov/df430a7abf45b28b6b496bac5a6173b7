It also DA leader Mmusi Maimane said presents the National Assembly s 400 members with a choice between President Jacob Zuma s continued stranglehold on the country s constitutional democracy or the development of South Africa and her people .Maimane took aim at ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe s criticism of the DA s motion as frivolous saying this undermines the executive oversight authority of the National Assembly and it shows a narrow understanding of the Constitution .Mantashe had said on Tuesday following a meeting of the party s national working committee that opposition parties calling for a motion of no confidence in Zuma was a reflection of their growing arrogance rather than reality and urged its members not to play to the gallery on this issueBut Maimane countered this saying the issue of President Zuma is not matter for Luthuli House to deal with internally because the only house with a constitutional mandate and responsibility to act is the National Assembly". It is therefore incumbent upon the National Assembly s ANC Members who derive their mandate from the people and Constitution to act in terms of the highest law in the land and to respond to the calls of the people for President Zuma to be removed from office.
