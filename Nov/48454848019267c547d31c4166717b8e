The Western Cape Government condemns cop killings. While we have no operational control over SAPS our government is committed to supporting the hard working officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect others. This reward should be a strong warning to anyone wishing to harm the brave men and women who serve our communities there are now an extra 100 000 reasons why you will not get away with it Plato said on Sunday.Though no reward would bring back the fallen officers to their loved ones Plato said he sincerely hoped that anyone with credible information on the incidents would do the right thing and assist the police and law enforcement authorities. It is important to remember that police killings however unrelated remain the vicious acts of individuals who do not represent the sentiment of the broader community. Only a select few in our society are responsible for these crimes. Those responsible for the crimes are however someone s child someone s sibling or someone s neighbour these are the people that need to break their silence and assist the police Plato said.Any information should be reported to the SAPS Crime Stop number on 0861 10111. We will not allow cowardly criminals to get away with their crimes unpunished. We will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the people of the Western Cape and our police officers Plato added.
