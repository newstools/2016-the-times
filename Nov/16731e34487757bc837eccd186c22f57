This comes after pictures of Limpopo prophet Lethebo of Mount Zion General Assembly spraying Doom on members of his congregation went viral on Monday.The prophet and members of his congregation believed that the 'blessed' insect repellent, had healing powers, after he had prayed over it.Adding his voice to this whole controversy, Dr Malinga took to Instagram to debut his new 'Doom song', in which he takes aim at the idea of spraying the pesticide for "healing" purposes.And did we mention how hilarious 'the track' is?
