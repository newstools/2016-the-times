The fire aboard Prime Time lead to deaths of four people - one from smoke inhalation while three drowned trying to escape the blaze.According to reports those who died were not wearing life jackets as they jumped into the water or tried to get on to boats that had come to rescue them.Twitter users expressed anger at what they believed was an apparent shortage of life jackets and improper security measures in place.One user Tammi Carter said: The ferry legally needs to have a life jacket for everyone on board if they didn't have enough the company could be in serious trouble! Especially because people died. Richard Glowacki highlighted the importance of security measures in light of the incident: After this incident I am sure many ferries/vessels will be checked out on a regular basis to make sure they fully licensed and have enough life jackets for every passenger. Roshan Lil-Ruthan said: This was our observation when we went here earlier this year in May. Too many operating with minimal safety measures. But this is prevalent everywhere in the world. God bless the families and friends and grant them peace in such a time as this. Mvn Mgovhela said: Arrest the owner of this thing. They have to take responsibility for this; it seems they only focus on the money but safety was last thing arrest them. Siliziwe Mazilazila opined that: That means this ferry was a floating coffin for a long time. No life jackets &amp; emergency drills or plans in place. Ignorance &amp; profits blinded them for too long. The owner of the boat Nico Wessels said 203 people were on board including staff members.The North West premier s office said investigations into the tragedy now include the owners of the boat club and the event organiser.The exact cause of the fire is still not yet known.Police spokeswoman Pelonomi Makau said the police investigations are under way.
