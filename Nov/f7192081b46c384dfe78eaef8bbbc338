In a statement on Wednesday following Trump's stunning victory Amnesty International secretary-general Salil Shetty said Trump's previous utterances over his election campaigning period were worrying. President-elect Trump has provoked grave consternation at many points throughout his election campaign and raised serious concerns about the strength of commitment we can expect to see from the United States towards human rights in the future. He must now put this behind him and both reaffirm and abide by the United States obligations on human rights at home and abroad. The organisation's executive director in the US Margaret Huang says Trump's comments in recent months have been disturbing and at times poisonous. This rhetoric cannot and must not become government policy. The xenophobic sexist and other hateful remarks made by Trump have no place in government. She added that the US failing to properly uphold its human rights obligations could have far-reaching consequences. From internment camps to the use of torture we have seen disastrous results when those we elect to represent us flout the United States obligations to uphold human rights. All who have been elected today from the executive office to city council should bear these lessons in mind. Professor Patrick Bond of the University of the Witwatersrand's School of Governance said human rights violations have already been a growing problem under president Barack Obama's administration. Under Trump things may deteriorate further he says. Under Obama police have been shooting black people left and right declaring an open hunting season the problem in the US will intensify. - TMG Digital
