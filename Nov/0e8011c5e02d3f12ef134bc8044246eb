This is after the ANC shot down a motion tabled by the EFF in Parliament on Tuesday calling for all apartheid laws to be repealed. The purpose of this motion was to allow a process that makes sure all the legislation passed under apartheid with the intent of realising the superiority rule and dominance of white people over blacks are removed. After humiliating and factually weak inputs the ANC caucus elected to vote against this motion. The implication of this vote is that we will continue to live with apartheid laws 22 years after democracy thus condemning our democratic dispensation to continue live under the shadow of the murderous apartheid regime the EFF said.It added that the fact that the ANC wanted to continue to use apartheid laws to fight battles against political opponents was clearly demonstrated by their usage of the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 which was about "protecting and advancing the dominance and supremacy of the white minority". The ANC brought charges against the [commander in chief of the EFF] CIC Julius Malema in the Newcastle Magistrate Court using this act with a view to suppress him and the Economic Emancipation Movement. This same Act was used in the Treason Trail against anti-apartheid activists who were in turn jailed for decades. This rejection of repealing apartheid laws must be seen as yet another sign of ANC's degeneration and that it is following on the path of post-colonial failure.That apartheid legislation is still here and alive 22 years into democracy is a sign of unfinished liberation. This is a political failure on the part of the ANC. It means finally we can actually say with confidence that the ANC has not only failed to provide economic freedom it has also failed to provide complete political freedom the EFF said.
