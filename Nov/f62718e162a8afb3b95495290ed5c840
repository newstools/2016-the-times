"The intensity of attacks on eastern Aleppo neighbourhoods in the past few days has forced thousands of civilians to flee to other parts of the city," UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien said.Reports from the UN's humanitarian partners in the Syrian city indicate that "up to 16,000 people have been displaced, many into uncertain and precarious situations. It is likely that thousands more will flee should the fighting spread and intensify over the coming days".The Syrian army advanced deep into the rebel stronghold of east Aleppo, taking over several neighbourhoods.Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency, said yesterday that 10,000 of those fleeing the carnage in eastern Aleppo had gone to districts held by the government in the west of the city.About 6,000 others had headed to the Kurdish-held Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood, he said.O'Brien voiced concern about the "deeply alarming and chilling situation unfolding" across Aleppo."The parties to the conflict in Syria have shown they are willing to take any action to secure military advantage even if it means killing, maiming or starving civilians into submission."
