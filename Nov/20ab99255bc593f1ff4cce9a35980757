The committee has asked him to come before it on Friday morning to explain the circumstances surrounding the withdrawal of charges against Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan and other individuals. The NPA backtracked from his decision to pursue fraud charges against Gordhan this week. If the committee wishes it has the power to recommend to the National Assembly that Abrahams be suspended. However only President Jacob Zuma has the power to remove Abrahams and even then it must be done after Abrahams is deemed to be unfit improper of guilty of misconduct ahead of the removal. During a briefing on land acquisition cases in partnership with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform Abrahams said he would ventilate the issues to the committee on Friday. I think it would be inappropriate to comment on the matter today. The committee have invited me to appear before them tomorrow morning. I will make a presentation on the reasons they have called me. I have appeared before them on the performance of the NPA for the 2015-2016 financial year said Abrahams. Abrahams stuck to his previous remarks that he would not resign over the withdrawal of charges against Gordhan. I have not yet considered stepping down. I will always do what is right and that is something that I have held to since the beginning of my career. I prefer to use my opportunity tomorrow to discuss this he said. - TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
