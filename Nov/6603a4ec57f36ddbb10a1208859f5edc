Mosimane has four players who played in the Caf Champions League final second leg match against Zamalek in Alexandria injured ahead of Saturday s Telkom Knockout second round Tshwane derby against SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday. Downs' coach said his side fielding fringe players had looked refreshed in a 2-0 league dispatching of a tricky Polokwane City at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday night.Mosimane made crucial changes as Sundowns bounced back from a 2-1 defeat at Loftus Versfeld against Cape Town City on Sunday where their frontline players had looked notably jaded. From yesterday [Wednesday] we looked better in terms of the tactical part of it. There s little bit of a problem for me because I ve unleashed a can of worms by dropping everybody yesterday and bringing in some players to bring back the spark Mosimane said. Because I believe mentally and physically we were on a bit of a honeymoon from the Champions League. I don t know if we are back but it was a good performance in the second half and even in the first half. It s a totally different game on Saturday because firstly it s a derby and secondly a cup. And I always believe cup games have a different tempo and emotions. We still have six important players who played in the last Champions League game against Zamalek who are not yet back. But yesterday we played without them and won so it should not be an excuse. Downs' run to being African champions with their 3-1 aggregate victory against Zamalek in the Caf final and punishing schedule where they have barely been aided in their task by the PSL s refusal to postpone the Brazilians midweek fixtures has taken its toll on their squad. Soumahoro Bangaly Anele Ngcongca Keagan Dolly Anthony Laffor Asavela Mbekile and Leonardo Castro are among players battling injury at Downs. - TMG Digital
