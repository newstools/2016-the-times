The US election appears to have been fantastic for Noah's career. The Daily Show was "the most watched" in October since Noah took over as host from Jon Stewart more than a year ago.Nielsen, a global marketing research company, found that October was The Daily Show's "most-watched month ever" with the highest ratings since February, particularly among audiences aged between 18 and 49.The show reached a multiplatform audience of 8.6million viewers, which included video on demand, digital and mobile platforms. Apart from the material that Trump provided, Noah told The Atlantic last week that being an outsider gave him an advantage."Well to me, everything is normal. That's probably my greatest gift. I thought it was a curse when I first came, but then I realised everything is normal. I actually wasted time listening to people when I first started the show . I didn't have the experience of the Sarah Palins and the Herman Cains, I was only operating from that view. Now I realise that that's my advantage."
