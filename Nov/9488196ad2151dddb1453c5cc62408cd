No excuses for absence would be accepted he said last week after about 17 MPs disobeyed his instruction for their compulsory attendance in the assembly on Wednesday.A total of 228 MPs voted in favour of the bill on Tuesday with 86 mostly DA MPs voting against it.The bill failed to be passed on two consecutive days on Tuesday and Wednesday last week much to the embarrassment of the ANC because there were not enough MPs in the house to make a quorum of 201.The walkout of DA and EFF MPs exposed the poor attendance of ANC MPs and meant that the important bill which adjusts allocations to national and provincial departments could not be adopted.The week-long delay has put pressure on the rest of the parliamentary programme. Immediately after its adoption in the National Assembly it will be adopted by the National Council of Provinces on Tuesday afternoon so that the National Assembly s appropriation committee can begin processing the amendments to the adjustment estimates.These amendments were proposed in the medium-term budget policy statement which was tabled in Parliament last month.There is pressure for the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces to adopt the finance laws before the end of the current parliamentary session on December 9 failing which the session would have to be extended for another week.
