It is the third goalless draw in a row for Chiefs who are now tie second with SuperSport United in the standings.It was a game that was slow in starting with Chiefs pushing the ball around smartly but making little impact. Baroka kept tight discipline in getting bodies behind the ball but whenever they did have possession quickly lost the ball.Chiefs quickly realised they were not going to make much progress through the middle and so pushed forward numbers for set pieces.George Lebese earned a soft free kick just after the half hour mark, which Keegan Buchanan floated in and Mulomowandau Mathoho headed over the Baroka crossbar.In the 37th minute Chiefs had their first effort on goal when Edward Manqele shot from a tight angle, the ball took a deflection off Baroka skipper Olaleng Shaku and only because of a desparate touch by keeper Oscarine Masuluke did it stay out.But the first half could have ended with Baroka ahead as Richard Matloga caught Mathoho for pace on the counter attack just before the break but provided a poor square ball with two teammates waiting to tuck it away from close range. It was a golden opportunity lost.Baroka started much better in the second half and forced an early chance with Sipho Moeti s shot testing a diving Itumeleng Khune after a poor clearance by Ramahlwe Mphahlele.But again the two club battled to create chances as the game struggled to get going.Chiefs brought on Michelle Katsvairo to beef up the attack and might have scored with his first touch as he headed a swirling corner from Tshabalala over the top.Chiefs and Baroka now look ahead to Telkom Knockout action at the weekend with both sides in quarter-final action.
