The giant second rower suffered concussion playing in the first Test of the current tour against England at Twickenham and has not made a rapid enough improvement to be considered for the clash against Wales. Etzebeth also missed last Saturday s debacle against Italy in Florence which ended in a 20-18 defeat for the Boks. It is highly unlikely he would be ready for this weekend Coetzee said. Eben didn t pass his protocols on Sunday that makes it unlikely. If he passed the five-day return-to-play protocol (on Monday) he would only be ready to take contact on Saturday so that makes it highly unlikely. No replacement would be called up for the match as there are still three fit locks Lood de Jager Pieter-Steph du Toit and Franco Mostert in the squad. Coetzee also confirmed that there were no other major injury concerns and the rest of the squad was fit and available for selection. In terms of his approach to the Wales Test coming off such a chastening loss Coetzee said he had challenged the team to finish the season on a high. The message to the team is simple we d like to finish on a high and fight back from where we currently are Coetzee said. We need to get out of the hole we are in play well and finish the season well. Every game is important to us and this one is no different. - TMG Digital
