The top price R67,000 was for a board by Lionel Smit followed by R55,000 for Brett Murray's board.The auction in Muizenberg was conducted by comedian Nic Rabinowitz and proceeds will be split between the National Sea Rescue Institute Waves for Change Shark Spotters and the South African Adaptive Surf Team.The board that attracted the most attention in the run-up to the sale was a carved white board by Jenna Barbe meant to resemble bleached white coral.Bleaching according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration occurs when changes in light temperatue or nutrients prompt the living corals to expel symbiotic algae living in their tissues causing them to turn completely white .The most common cause is warmer water temperatures but corals can recover if the stress does not last too long.Said Barbe: I source reject surfboard blanks to reduce the impact on our landfills. The white flakey and powdery nature of the substrate emphasises the fragility of the coral forms that cover the surface. This speaks to the current conversation around global warming specifically coral bleaching. The piece acts as a relic or fragment of this precious resource. TMG Digital/The Times
