The Minister was on Friday meeting the chairpersons of all Water Boards and Utilities across South Africa to assess current drought interventions implementation of water restrictions and the management and implementation of major water and sanitation infrastructure projects.Pastor Mboro announced that his national rain prayer session would be held on Sunday at his Incredible Happenings Church in Katlehong Ekurhuleni."Speakers include Minister of Water and Sanitation Mrs Nomvula Mokonyane Gauteng MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza and Ekurhuleni Executive Mayor Cllr Mzwandile Masina " he said.This prayer session comes after the South African Weather Services predicted that South Africa will have a wet early summer season due to a weak La Nina.Unfortunately it is unclear whether the La Nina will actually break the drought, as it is expected to decay before it gains any momentum.The Ekurhuleni Metro announced earlier on Friday that it will start with water-rationing measures from Monday in an effort to save water. The city has no choice but to take this drastic step as voluntary water saving measures by residents have averaged a savings rate of about 3.5% a week a far cry from the required 15% the metropolitan municipality said in a statement. Recent rains have not significantly improved water levels [therefore] the country needs good rainfall for an extended period to come out of the drought of recent years. The metro said water rationing measures will initially be implemented every day from 9pm to 5am nightly starting from November 7.If these measures do not achieve the required 15% reduction in usage the city will ration water during the day as well it said.
