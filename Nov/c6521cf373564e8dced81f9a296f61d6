Letsholonyane is playing the best football of his life at United and in perhaps one of football's delectable ironies, his former employers Chiefs - who decided against renewing his contract in May - have continued to struggle.The midfield player's name was bound to come up at Naturena Village as Amakhosi were preparing to host a United side teeming with many of their former players.Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka conceded that they had been watching Letsholonyane with a little more than a passing interest.Maluleka, a former United player, said: "Well, it is going to be the same as when I was still at Ajax Cape Town or Supersport United and playing against him [when Letsholonyane was still at Chiefs]."As you know, 'Yeye' is a quality player and I will never take anything away from him. At the moment he is on form and I can't say how I am going to stop him."The fourth-placed United are level on 16 points, with Chiefs fifthby virtue of a goal difference.Matches between the two have an added attraction and often resemble a reunion of former classmates.United have a Chiefs feel about them. Besides Letsholonyane, the Tshwane club have former Chiefs mentor Stuart Baxter as head coach, centreback Morgan Gould, left-back Keegan Ritchie, centre-back Tefu Mashamaite and goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse.Mashamaite, who joined United in September after a season at Swedish club BK Hacken, was the fifth signing of a player with whom Baxter won league and cup doubles at Chiefs in 2012-2013 and 2014-2015.Chiefs are coming back from a 2-1 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns at the weekend and will be desperate to avoid a loss to another title contending side.- TMG Digital
