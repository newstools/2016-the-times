Researchers examined data on breastfeeding and infant pain during needle sticks from 10 previously published studies, with a total of 1066 babies aged between one and 12 months. On average, breastfeeding babies cried for 38 seconds less than babies who did not nurse during vaccinations, researchers reported in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.Pain scores based on observations of the behaviour of babies were also lower when infants were breastfed during needle sticks."We already knew that breastfeeding reduced pain during blood collection in newborn babies," said lead study author Denise Harrison, a researcher at the University of Ottawa and Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Canada."However, we did not know if the same effects would be evident in older babies."To assess the potential for breastfeeding to curb pain in babies after the first month of life, researchers analysed data from studies that compared nursing to alternative pain-relief methods, such as bottles of formula, dummies, cuddling and skin-to-skin contact. Previous studies looked at a variety of needle-stick procedures in addition to vaccinations.
