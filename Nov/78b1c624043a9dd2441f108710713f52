KwaZulu-Natal Democratic Alliance chairman Haniff Hoosen said on Tuesday that the party is laying a charge of crimen injuria against Dawie Kriel for his offensive social media outburst at the weekend. This language has no place in our Constitutional democracy where the right to religious freedom is enshrined in our Bill of Rights. It is disgustingly hateful and fundamentally undermines the dignity of many South Africans said Hoosen. We also welcome the decision by the South African Human Rights Commission to investigate the matter. We look forward to the report being made public as soon as it is complete. Kriel s post went viral and caused outrage after he complained that despite an outcry over fireworks every year they were imported by the container load. To those idol worshippers and devil disciples who buy them in the name of religion it read before making derogatory and offensive remarks. I could strangle you morons with my bare hands and derive great pleasure in watching your face turn blue and your tongue pop out he added.Kriel has since publicly apologised for his actions. Anger is not an excuse and I realise the foolishness of my remarks he posted a day later on Facebook.- TMG Digital
