In an unprecedented turn of events, the bill, which allows for government revenue to be transferred to the provinces and departments, could not be passed on two occasions this week as the ANC did not have sufficient numbers in the house.Speaking after addressing his caucus yesterday, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said the failure to transfer the bill was embarrassing."The bill is critical to the government's ability to continue its service-delivery obligations and parliament's delay means the allocation of revenue to departments will not occur as planned."He said that 40 of the ANC's 249 MPs had been granted leave of absence for Wednesday. The remaining 209 had all confirmed their attendance in the house.The bill was only able to muster 193 votes of the 201 required.The names of those who had been absent without leave would be forwarded to the ANC's caucus disciplinary committee, headed by MP Mathole Motshekga, to be formally charged, Mthembu said.They could face warnings or fines and could face being referred for further sanctions to the ANC's national disciplinary committee.Mthembu said he had also reminded the caucus of a resolution taken earlier this year that repeat offenders could face losing their jobs.He also said ministers and deputy ministers were not exempt from disciplinary procedures if they were found to be absent without leave because they were still MPs and members of the caucus.Minister Jeff Radebe said during his post-cabinet briefing yesterday that the cabinet had discussed Tuesday's failure to pass the bill when it met on Wednesday.Yet despite the cabinet expressing its "grave concern" that morning, by late Wednesday the ANC was again unable to pass the bill."It is very bad not to pass what is essentially a budget because it means that government plans can't be implemented," the minister said.
