Francois-Marie Marret was given a two-year sentence for fraud for blending poor quality wine with high-end Saint-Emilions, Lalande-de-Pomerols and Listrac-Medocs to sell under prestigious labels.The 800,000-litre "moon wine" fraud, so called because the cheap wine was spirited to his operation by night, was uncovered thanks to diligent French customs inspectors who track the wine produced by France's tens of thousands of vineyards to protect the country's industry - and to make sure drinkers get what they pay for.This accounting revealed the "moon wine fraud", which saw Marret fined $8.9-million."It started with inconsistencies between the stocks checked on the ground and the documents filed by chateaus," says Jeff Omari, deputy director of customs in Bordeaux.Customs officers dissected the movement of wine around the vineyards in question and analysed samples "to work up through the chain of fraud and all the players involved: winemakers, brokers, transporters, and so on - nearly two years of investigation in total", Omari said.
