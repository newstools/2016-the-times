The 2970-ton Verano started burning on November 2 while berthed at quay 703 in the port. Smoke from the smouldering vessel billowed across the CBD for days as fire-fighting teams from the port and city worked to contain the blaze. Transnet National Ports Authority said in a statement on Wednesday that the fire had been fully extinguished by 6pm on Tuesday. All boundary cooling activities are discontinued though fire services have been placed on standby for any emergencies. The vessel is still listing to starboard but remains stable said the port authority. A salvage crew is now examining the vessel while the cause of the fire is yet to be determined. The vessel was reported to be carrying 150 kl of fuel and 800 000 pieces of plastic packaging material.
