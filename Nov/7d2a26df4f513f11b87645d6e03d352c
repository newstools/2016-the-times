The public broadcaster which has lost several battles involving its controversial former chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng tried to convince a full bench at the Supreme Court of Appeal that the High Court in Johannesburg got it wrong when it threw out its case against Masstores.But Acting Judge of Appeal Ashton Schippers said the SABC's claim which arose out of an order for 2 500 TVs at Game in Polokwane was "opportunistic and contrived".The TVs were ordered in 2011 by EduSolutions the company responsible for the 2012 Limpopo textbook crisis which planned to deliver them to schools throughout the province.Masstores gave EduSolutions a R10-million 30-day credit facility but the SABC wrote to the retailer claiming it had handed over the TVs before EduSolutions had secured a TV licence.It claimed R3 000 for each of the 2 500 Samsung TVs involved in the deal and refused to back down even when Masstores explained that no money changed hands before the licence was issued.Said Schippers: "From the outset EduSolutions was informed that the sale would not be concluded unless and until it was in possession of the requisite licence. That is indeed what happened."The SABC's contention that the payment credit facility agreement constitutes a sale is quite wrong and insupportable."The court was told that in the 12 months from July 2010 to June 2011 only one of the 327 900 TV sets sold by Masstores had an unresolved licence query.
