In the last stop of an farewell tour that included visits to Greece and Germany, Obama continued his efforts to calm anxieties since Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the US presidential race."My main message to you, and the message I delivered in Europe, is don't just assume the worst," Obama told a group of young people during a question-and-answer session in Peru."Wait until the administration is in place - it's putting its policies together - and then you can make your judgments as to whether it's consistent with the international community's interests in living in peace and prosperity together."Trump won the election after promising to build a wall on the US border with Mexico, rip up trade deals and temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US.Obama has sought to soothe fears by pledging to ensure a smooth transition of power and expressing optimism that the president-elect would shift away from inflammatory campaign rhetoric once he faced the realities of the job."It will be important for everybody around the world not to make immediate judgments but give this new president-elect a chance to put his team together, to examine the issues, to determine what the policies will be, because, as I've always said, how you campaign isn't always the same as how you govern," Obama said.
