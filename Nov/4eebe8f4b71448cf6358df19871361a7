The trio - Armando Mkhabela David Mabaso and Jacob Ntuli - pleaded guilty but they told the high court in Pretoria that they were shocked by the sentence handed down by a magistrate. hey argued that they did not execute their plan to poach a rhino from the Kruger Park and that they were enticed to commit the offence by an undercover police officer. But Acting Judge Cassim Sardiwalla said their arguments held no water. "If it was not for the preventive action of the police they would have executed their conspiracy and it was in the interest of justice to arrest [them] rather than to wait for them to carry out their plan " he said.Sardiwalla said the "endemic" level of rhino poaching had led to "a general outcry for strong action to curb [these] offences". He added: "The [undercover] police official had only on one occasion mentioned that money could be made in this manner. Thereafter eight calls were made to him to arrange the intended crime. "There can be no question that [the men] were unfairly or unlawfully induced into this course of conduct." - TMG Digital/The Times
