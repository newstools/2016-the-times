The show was on the Saturday."She didn't bat an eyelid. She was so comfortable in herself and we knew she could handle it," said a source.Because it was a world stage and MTV wanted to lessen the pressure, B was given two side-kicks.But come next year, she might go at it alone."We've all realised she can do it. It was a global stage and B is a professional. She was flawless."Yes. Slay girl.
