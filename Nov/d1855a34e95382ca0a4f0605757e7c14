By now you probably know that former England footballer David Beckham was in the country on Monday to speak at the Discovery Leadership Summit.And while we hear that his talk was super inspiring, we would probably have missed half of it just staring at his, uh, amazing physique.Now imagine if we could get a picture with him? Minnie, Thomas and Maps did and we were totes jealous."Now this is a brand. Listening to his story was completely inspirational," Minnie said of her meeting with the star.While Maps recounted how he had a quick chat with Becks about football- as besties do.And poor Thomas was just worried about dressing properly for the occasion.Lucky buggers.A photo posted by Thomas Mlambo (@thomasmlambo) on Nov 14, 2016 at 9:32am PSTA photo posted by Minnie (@minniedlamini) on Nov 14, 2016 at 7:16am PSTA photo posted by Maps Maponyane (@mmaponyane) on Nov 14, 2016 at 11:06am PSTA photo posted by Thomas Mlambo (@thomasmlambo) on Nov 14, 2016 at 9:32am PSTA photo posted by Minnie (@minniedlamini) on Nov 14, 2016 at 7:16am PSTA photo posted by Maps Maponyane (@mmaponyane) on Nov 14, 2016 at 11:06am PST Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
