For single men and women on remote farms or in tiny villages, "Bachelor and Spinster" balls offer a better chance of finding love than dating apps like Tinder.The balls, a decades-old tradition in outback Australia, still attract thousands of young adults looking for love - or to get rolling drunk."It's very old-school," said Emily Pitt, a 24-year-old from the town of Gulgong. "It's how country singles meet each other."Ariah Park, some 400km west of Sydney, has a population of just 500. But on the last Saturday of October the village is inundated with pick-up trucks, which roar up to a dried-out paddock to deposit partygoers.About 1500 people showed up for this year's outdoor drinking and dancing extravaganza, the second-biggest turnout in the event's 32-year history.While the ball has a black-tie dress code, the warm-up party is a casual affair, with people wearing scruffy T-shirts, shorts and flip- flops and drinking heavily.When night falls partygoers change into their formal attire and pack into a marquee where they stomp their boots and toss their cowboy hats into the air as they dance to country rock tunes.The balls are notorious for binge drinking, casual sex and dangerous driving antics.Ariah Park revellers get unlimited alcohol for their Aus$120 (R1275) entry ticket and a goody bag that includes a plastic beer cup and a condom.
