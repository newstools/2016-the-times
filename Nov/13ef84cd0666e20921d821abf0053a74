South Africa is experiencing its lowest rainfall since 1904 because of the El Ni o weather phenomenon.Now, with just over a month to go before millions traditionally head to coastal towns and cities of the Cape and KwaZulu-Natal for Christmas, resort and guesthouse owners are fearing the worst.Water restrictions have been tightened in Johannesburg. The city has implemented level2 water restrictions, which prohibit the watering of gardens before 6pm. The restrictions are expected to be adopted by other metros.A number of suburbs are likely to experience water cuts from Wednesday.Jannie Vermeulen, who owns the Cape Karoo Guest Lodge, said that 80% of the town's water came from boreholes."The underground water levels are decreasing. We have got a terrible problem in terms of water pressure and have had to ask guests to use water sparingly."We haven't had a decline in business yet, but if the problem persists we would get to a point where we would have to let people know that we have water problems."That could lead to cancellations," said Vermeulen.William Vela of the Algoa Inn Guesthouse in Port Elizabeth said he had felt the pinch from his water bill."I can't afford it and if it keeps getting worse I don't know what it will mean for the guesthouse."Michele Rust, who manages Glenview Guesthouse, near Durban, said she had felt the effects of the drought, especially the fines imposed on guesthouses that exceed usage limits."I have had to ask guests to limit their showers to 10 minutes. Some come from areas where they are experiencing shortages and then they abuse the water here. Some shower for over 30 minutes."Rust said the abuse had led to her water bill increasing by over R4000. She said she had stopped watering the guesthouse's gardens to conserve water.
