It is a stance that provokes outrage among many Muslims but Muhsin Hendricks has built up a small, loyal congregation by helping worshippers try to reconcile their sexuality with their religion."There is this love-hate relationship from the Muslim community," Hendricks said."Sometimes they feel that I should be thrown from the highest mountain, and sometimes they appreciate that there is one imam who is willing to work with people whom they are unwilling to work with."In 1996, Hendricks founded The Inner Circle, a support group for Muslims living in Cape Town who felt rejected because of their sexual orientation. This led to his setting up the mosque five years ago.In contrast to the emotions that surround the explosive topic of Islam and homosexuality, the mosque offers a calm and open place for gay Muslims to worship together."I got divorced at 29 after being married for six years," Henrdicks, 48, said."I needed to be authentic with myself, and part of that process was to 'come out'."Today the mosque has about 25 regular worshippers .Most Muslim leaders in Cape Town take a clear stand against homosexuality ."Homosexuality is unacceptable and the punishment will be the fire," said Imam Yusuf Pandy, leader of a mosque in Mowbray, Cape Town."How can you be homosexual? It is forbidden. And it is your duty as an imam or as a Muslim to go and speak to them and say: 'No, it cannot be'," he said.The Inner Circle has worked for 20 years to support gay Muslims, often struggling to survive against overwhelming opposition from orthodox Islam."The messaging that the Muslim community gets about queer issues comes from a clergy that is completely homophobic," said Abdul Karriem Matthews, programme manager for the support group.For worshippers such as Zaid Philander, a local art teacher, the mosque is a refuge, as well as giving access to counselling. He endured a harrowing "corrective" ritual led by a quack in Cape Town."There are a lot of lives being destroyed based on sexuality and religion, and that needs to change," he said. "Here they are the pioneers of this change, and this is a good place to start."
