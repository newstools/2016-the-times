The German International School Cape Town in Tamboerskloof has installed a solar electricity system that sustains the school of 850 pupils.In addition, surplus energy is fed into the city grid.Wolfgang Tiefensee, minister for economic affairs, science and digital agenda for the German state of Thuringia, turned on the switch at a special event yesterday.Three German companies are behind the project.SolarWorld Africa supplied the photovoltaic panels, SMA Solar Technology provided solar inverters and Schletter installed the system."On most days we supply the entire school and still feed excess energy into the grid of the City of Cape Town."This plant teaches our learners the value of sustainable energy generated by green technology and being conscious of the environmental challenges, which is all part of the 'going green' campaign for our school,'' said principal Alexander P Kirmse.Gregor K pper, managing director of SolarWorld Africa, said the system would save the school an enormous amount of money in the next 25 years.
