Yesterday the students, frustrated by the perceived lack of action from Wits University management to the alleged rape, accused it on social media of protecting the "perpetrator", who is also a student, and posted pictures of the man.Gender-based violence researcher Lisa Vetten warned the students of a potential defamation lawsuit."Our law protects the identity of both parties. If the case is still pending and no criminal charges have been laid, the students who posted those pictures could be sued for defamation of character."I know they might feel frustrated. In most cases when people name and shame it is because they feel that justice was denied."Criminal lawyer Ulrich Roux said even if the person had not been charged one could not reveal his identity until he was given a fair chance in a court of law. Wits confirms student raped at residence"Society cannot pass judgment or try him on social media."The alleged rape took place at the Wits Junction residence three weeks ago. The rape complainant had deferred her exams to be with her family out of the country, said the Wits Gender Equity Office.Professor Bonita Meyersfeld from the gender office said members of the group had been working with the victim for the past three weeks, giving her counselling and necessary support in line with the sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape policy at the university.Nkululeko Tselane, chairman of Wits Junction residence, said the victim was not a South African and she had decided not to press charges because she intended moving back to her home country."She has not filed any criminal charges against him because her fear is that she would have to come back into the country and perpetually attend court cases. She didn't want to put herself through that."Tselane said students had forced the alleged rapist out of the residence on Wednesday because management failed to do so."We didn't understand why it had to take a Twitter trend to get management to say something. It is concerning that Wits doesn't appear to take sexual violence seriously," he said.Police spokesman Lieutenant Kay Makhubela urged anyone who had details of the alleged rape to come forward. He said normally the victim would open a case but in this case anyone who had details of what happened could open a case."Without the information we cannot investigate anything or arrest anyone. We were told that the alleged rape happened three weeks ago, but we do not have any record of a case being opened."
