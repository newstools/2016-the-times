Southern Africa s biggest football fixture was broadcast live in Sweden and television viewers in that part of the world nearly fell off their chairs when they saw fans from the two sides enjoying the game without a care in the world.Swedish National Television journalist Johan Ripas covered the game for the Scandinavian country and he told Times Media Digital that his countrymen could not get over seeing the two sets of supporters sitting side by side in the stands. The Swedish people were amazed when they saw rivals supporters sitting together in a derby game. How can this be? the bemused journalist asked. This blew my mind and this is what the Swedish people are also saying. On my way to the stadium I saw supporters of the two clubs travelling together in busses minibuses and cars. This is unbelievable. And when I get to the stadium I see that there is no special fencing to deter hooligans or prevent supporters from mingling. This is amazing. The Swedish National Television journalist has been based in this part of the world for two year and is the station s Africa correspondent. But he had never attended a Soweto Derby until he was assigned to the game last week.The Scandinavian nation took a little more than a passing interest in the match when the game was televised live in Sweden and Ripas assignment was to give the people back home an idea of what a Chiefs vs Pirates fixture is all about. I have to say it was the first time in my life I saw a fixture like this. The Swedish people fell in love with the venue (Soccer City) and with the game itself. I was hoping for a lot of goals and that was the only disappointing thing. We can t wait for the next (derby) .Pirates and Chiefs drew to a typically drab 0-0 draw last week. TMG Digital
