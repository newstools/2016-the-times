Steyn clutched his shoulder while bowling early in the second hour of day two of the first match of the rubber at the WACA on Friday.He sank to his haunches and left the field after consulting with team physiotherapist Brandon Jackson.Minutes later Steyn was seen in the dressingroom with his shoulder - the same one he broke in December during the series against England - heavily strapped.During the tea interval he was seen congratulating his teammates for dismissing Australia by slapping them on the back - but only with his left hand. He held his right arm at an awkward angle.Before stumps a Cricket South Africa release quoted team manager Mohammed Moosajee as saying Steyn was taken to the hospital for preliminary scans which confirmed a new fracture of the bone in the shoulder joint . He will take no further part in the match (he will bat if absolutely necessary) and the series and will return to South Africa to see a shoulder specialist who will advise on an appropriate plan of action. An injury of this nature is rare and will in all likelihood require surgery but that will only be confirmed once we receive an opinion from the specialist. No decision has been made on whether a replacement will be summoned.#CSAnews Shoulder injury rules @DaleSteyn62 out of series https://t.co/M01IgclQDm pic.twitter.com/4c48XAeBXt Cricket South Africa (@OfficialCSA) November 4, 2016 #CSAnews Shoulder injury rules @DaleSteyn62 out of series https://t.co/M01IgclQDm pic.twitter.com/4c48XAeBXt TMG Sport
