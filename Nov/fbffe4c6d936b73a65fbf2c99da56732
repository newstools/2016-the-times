England No8 Billy Vunipola clashed heavily against Etzebeth's head late in the first half, forcing the Bok bruiser out of the remainder of the match, which England won 37-21.Springbok coach Allister Coetzee confirmed that the 54-cap veteran would miss the match against Italy, but he was still in the frame to play against Wales on November 26."Eben hasn't done his full protocols yet, but he has been presenting symptoms [of concussion]," Coetzee said."He had nausea and he is still having a few headaches. It's a five-day process."He is definitely out of the match against Italy but he will stay with the squad because he could be ready for the following week."Pieter-Steph will move back to lock with Lood de Jager and we still have Franco Mostert in the squad."We won't fly another player out because Uzair Cassiem from the Cheetahs has also joined us."Coetzee does have a selection headache, though, because De Jager has a bruised thigh, while Du Toit is also nursing bruises from the Twickenham battle.But De Jager declared that he would be ready by Saturday."I'm available for the weekend. I just have a bit of a contusion on my quad and we are monitoring with the doctor, but I'm confident I'll be ready," he said."It was my first start since August and it was good to be back on the field and get 65 minutes."It has been a frustrating year for me. I've not managed to string more than three games together due to injury and a suspension."I need to get match fitness and confidence," De Jager said. - TMG Digital
