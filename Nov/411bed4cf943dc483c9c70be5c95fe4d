The project appears to be faltering because of the limited goods and services Gauteng government departments can buy from township companies.This has driven the department of infrastructure development to cut the amount of goods and services it plans to procure from township companies to below R500,000.Department head Bethuel Netshiswinzhe disclosed on Friday that it had managed to spend only 2.81% of its procurement budget on t ownship companies."We're pushing to the extent that we can, and we accept that there are things we cannot get in the township, which is why we are working to expand the township economy."Makhura said: "It is not as if we're underspending [on township procurement] because of a lack of attention [to the sector], but because there is a limit to what we can access."He said his office would be using township-based communication companies.
