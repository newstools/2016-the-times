"First head to roll. Put simply he had no credibility left after the Public Protector report regardless of them being proven or not allegations " Montalto said."Brian is the fallen angel for investors coming out of Transnet as a hero and now implicated in alleged grand corruption and rent extraction by the PP report. In a way it's sad in a way it's not. He ultimately was successful because he could navigate the patronage realities of the ANC but it has caught up with him."We need to understand however that the rot in Eskom goes much deeper - the whole board needs to be replaced and there are many others there also implicated in the PP report."Montalto was pessimistic about a new broom sweeping clean at the state entity."I do not see this as a positive . . . As long as the board is in place and other senior management nothing changes. If the CFO is appointed CEO that is not positive and would be a sign of status quo."
