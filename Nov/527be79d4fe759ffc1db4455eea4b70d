Speaking at a Red October Campaign rally at Sebokeng in Gauteng Nzimande called for an intensification in the struggle against the abuse of state organs aimed at advancing parasitic accumulation .He said that if half of what was in Sunday s newspapers was true that there was a renewed plot to charge the Minister of Finance again and that some of the state organs were targeted at tarnishing the image of the Secretary-General of the ANC Gwede Mantashe and other ANC leaders the SACP was saying Enough is enough and no more . We are today drawing a red line and we call upon the people of South Africa especially the workers and the poor to stop this rot and abuse of state organs for purposes of serving narrow accumulation agendas. As the SACP we are prepared to fight this scourge in the same manner as we fought in defence of Comrade Jacob Zuma some ten to thirteen years ago when we believed state organs were being used to pursue narrow political agendas. If we do not do so all of us will be in the queue of being harassed for narrow political reasons. As the SACP we are also acutely aware that those who are pursuing these political agendas have no interest of our country at heart but are prepared to if need be sink our country into a political and economic abyss in order to hide their parasitic interests Nzimande charged.He called on SACP members and patriots to stop the plundering of our state resources and the use of its organs by a parasitic bourgeoisie . We must also be vigilant and defend our state-owned companies as institutions aimed advancing the economic interests of the overwhelming majority of the workers and poor of our country. The state was not for sale he warned adding that corporate capture of the state only served to undermine the interests and struggles of the workers and the country s poor.Parasites like the Guptas Nzimande said were no alternative to monopoly capital. We therefore need to fight both monopoly capital and the Guptarisation of our state with the same ferocity and vigour. Today we call upon all Communists the workers and poor of our country to intensify the struggle against monopolisation and the Guptarisation of our state. TMG Digital
