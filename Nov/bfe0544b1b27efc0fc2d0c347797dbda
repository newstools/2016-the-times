On Wednesday Miss SA Nthandoyenkosi Kunene revealed two of the dresses she'll be taking with to the global contest in the US. Her national dress designed by JJ Schoeman was inspired by her home province Mpumalanga.Schoeman who designed all of her garments said the inspiration for the national dress was the province's nickname the place of the rising sun.He deliberately steered clear of animal prints and cultural references which previous national dresses have incorporated. "The inspiration was quite simple.We tapped into Nthando and who she is and where she's from. Mpumalanga is the place of the rising sun. If you think about our beautiful country we have beautiful sunrises.It's usually a controversial piece because of our different cultures and who we are " he said. Kunene couldn't hold back the tears as she thanked her parents sponsors and South Africans for supporting her. "I come as one but behind me there's the support of a nation. I've always dreamed about being Miss SA but I never thought about Miss World. Standing here is a humbling moment " she said."The journey to Miss World is going to be a beautiful one simply because I always give my best. I'm feeling very confident in the stories I will share from my country."Kunene will be leaving for the Miss World pageant in Washington in the US on Friday November 25 to prepare for the event in December.- TMG Digital/The Times
