A recent report in Sunday World claimed that Hlaudi had met with the soapie bosses to express his concern with the low increases that staff and talent had received.Speaking to TshisaLIVE this week, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago confirmed that Hlaudi had met with the show's producers to ask them to increase the amount given to actors and staff, but said that they could not directly force the producers to do so."The SABC cannot regulate increases. That is a matter between the production houses and the talent. The SABC raised the concern as an interested party in the matter," Kganyago said.And even though Kganyago said there was no feud between the production houses and the SABC, he said any kind of dispute between the houses and their talent would affect the broadcaster, and they would therefore need to act.Kganyago would not be drawn on whether the broadcaster would take any action against the production houses if their concerns were not addressed."We were simply raising a caution. We have intervened before, like with Generations, but we cannot pre-empt anything at the moment," Kaizer said.
