However, Madonsela said yesterday she was "comfortable" with the remedial action she had recommended - "a commission of inquiry where the judge is selected by the chief justice and appointed by the president".Madonsela said if Zuma decided to take her report on legal review she would "consider being an intervening party because I am a citizen and like any other citizen I am concerned about people in government evading accountability."I had to make compromises to minimise the possibility of a successful review. I still believe [Zuma] was given a fair process, which he snubbed, but the lawyers felt a judge would think that I should have given him as much time as he wanted," she said."I still think that no judge would find against me but the legal process is not an exact science. You cannot say it will go the way you want. The one thing those processes succeeded in doing was that I withdrew some of my findings I had made, so it was a successful strategy."There were findings we were considering but at the end of the day we could not make them. I gave him the opportunity to answer my questions. I made it easier for him . by giving him the questions in advance. He gave me an undertaking that he would answer those questions and on that Monday he chose not to answer those questions and never came back to me. Instead he rushed to court. For me that was acting in bad faith."She said the yardstick she used to judge Zuma and his ministers was no different from the one she used on herself when she had to answer questions in parliament."When parliament asked me questions, I did not filibuster. I complied because public accountability is part of our job description when we sign up to work for the state. In their case, they get what they want by evading public accountability. That bothers me," she said.
