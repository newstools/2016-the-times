With only four wins from 10 Tests in 2016, and just one victory in their last six Tests, a simple win over the Italians will be an immeasurable boost of confidence for the beleaguered team.With Wales to come next weekend, the Boks need every ounce of confidence they can draw from what could be a tricky match, which is expected to be played in drizzling conditions, before going to Cardiff.Coach Allister Coetzee made two changes to the starting lineup to the team that lost 37-21 to England at Twickenham last week and three on the bench. Veteran wing Bryan Habana returns after injury and flank Nizaam Carr will start for the first time, at openside.Carr will be a central figure tomorrow as the Boks have identified the breakdown as a key battleground this week."We've got to win the race to the ball this weekend," Coetzee said. "Italy tackle around the legs with the first man coming in hard over the ball. So we have to make sure we win that race."Nizaam should do well in that department in securing possession to build continuity for us."The All Blacks thrashed Italy 68-10 last weekend, scoring 10 tries in the process. But Coetzee wasn't reading much into that considering his own problems this season."It would be a mistake to compare ourselves to New Zealand," Coetzee said. "They're a well-oiled machine and there's continuity in their group."[Italy coach] Conor O'Shea is starting with a new group of players, and I know what it's like trying to get a team to gel. He's trying to get a system in place, looking for the right players and continuity."With Pieter-Steph du Toit and Lood de Jager reunited at lock due to Eben Etzebeth's concussion, the lineout shouldn't suffer, while the scrum shouldn't be underpowered either.Defensively however, the Boks have been poor, conceding 31 tries in those 10 Tests.Habana, who will win his 124th Test cap for the Boks, sat in the coach's box at Twickenham on Saturday and found it stressful. "I've only sat in the coach's box twice before in my career (in 2004 and 2011) and it was a weird feeling," Habana said."There was a lot of frustration seeing how well we played for 30 minutes and then making three or four mistakes that England capitalised on."We are in a tough situation but there is no one who is going to get us out of it but ourselves.
