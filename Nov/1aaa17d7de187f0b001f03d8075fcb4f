The poignance of a game won and lost was all around.South Africa - without AB de Villiers, without for the most part Dale Steyn, with a single run in two innings from Hashim Amla, with only two seamers, a debutant and a host of part-timers, with Australia on 158 without loss in reply to their first innings of 242 at stumps after the second day - had won the first Test by 177 runs.How had that happened?With every crunch of those spikes the answer drew nearer. Around the corner came Faf du Plessis.He upped a thumb at the three reporters who arrived too late for Steve Smith's press conference, and looked at the shut door behind which the Australian captain was trying to explain what had happened and turned on his heel.There was no hurry. Nothing could change what had happened.After a few minutes the door opened and Smith snuck out looking like he would rather be somewhere else. Anywhere else.Who could blame him. He had had to explain Australia's fourth loss on the bounce in Test cricket, their sixth consecutive defeat to South Africa and why they went down in a first home summer Test since 1988.Then came Du Plessis and his thoughts tumbled out in a happy stream of consciousness."In my career that's one of the most special days," he said."To turn it around 360 degrees from day one to day two was one of the best days of cricket I've been involved in."To have a seamer down pretty much the whole Test match and to do what we've done, we always joke about it, that if you lose a seamer in a three-seamer attack its 99% impossible to win a game of Test cricket because it's just too much workload on the bowlers."Somehow we managed to do it and there's a lot of credit that goes to this man over here."With that he landed a hearty slap on the thigh of Kagiso Rabada sitting beside him as the man-of-the-match for his haul of 5/92 in the second innings."He's bowled really well. Also Keshav (Maharaj). He relentlessly bowled in a good area and made sure we could rotate the guys from the other end and just build pressure," he said.Australia, looking to bat all day, resumed on 169/4. That was always going to be unlikely, but to get through them South Africa needed patience and expert management of their resources.They showed ample amounts of both and reaped the rewards.None more so than Rabada."I'm [sharing my room] with him tonight," Du Plessis said as he hugged his new favourite fast bowler."Every time I asked him if he was tired, he said: 'No. You're not taking the ball out of my hand.'"That's a sign of a champion bowler for me."
