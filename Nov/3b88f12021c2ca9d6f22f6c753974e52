Bavuma struck an hour before the interval when he swooped into the covers from point to run out the dangerous Warner with a diving direct hit on the stumps at the non-striker s end.Warner who clipped his 33 off 35 balls with six fours had edged Kagiso Rabada s previous delivery marginally over the outstretched hands of Dean Elgar at third slip.Australia needed a major contribution from Warner to retain serious hopes of chasing down what would be a world record target.Four balls after Warner went Rabada had Australia s other opener Shaun Marsh caught by Faf du Plessis at second slip.That reduced the home side to 52/2 but Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith took them to tea without further incident.South Africa declared their second innings closed on 540/8 when Vernon Philander was bowled by Smith for 73 with the 19th ball after lunch to end a stand of 72 shared with debutant Keshav Maharaj.Quinton de Kock and Philander resumed on 390/6 and extended their partnership to 116 before in the 11th over before lunch De Kock was out for 64 when he drove a catch to cover off Mitchell Marsh.The Australians squandered a chance to dismiss Philander for 29 in the seventh over of the day when Josh Hazlewood palmed a lofted drive off Mitchell Starc onto the fine leg boundary for six.TMG Digital
