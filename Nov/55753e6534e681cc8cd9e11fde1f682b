Criminal expert Warrant Officer Phillip Bekker taking the stand for the second day on Tuesday morning said the Blue Star spray turned a fluorescent blue indicating a positive result. A problem that sometimes occurs is that the iron in the metal of the boot could also result in a false positive Bekker told the Port Elizabeth High Court.He was still of the opinion however that the substance spotted by police was blood.Bekker also attempted to collect touch DNA from the money allegedly used to pay the hitmen but as was the case in thousands of similar studies this proved too difficult.Touch DNA is the collection of stem cells in addition to fingerprints.Jayde s kidnapping and murder was allegedly orchestrated by her husband Christopher Panayiotou 30.The state alleges middleman Luthando Siyoni hired hitmen Sizwezakhe Vumazonke and Sinethemba Nemembe to carry out the hit. Zolani Sibeko is charged as a co-conspirator.Bekker also told the court how Jayde 29 must have been in a crouching position when she was shot twice in the back. She then slumped to the ground before her shooter fired the final shot to her head.Testimony continues on Tuesday afternoon.- TMG Digital/HeraldLIVE
