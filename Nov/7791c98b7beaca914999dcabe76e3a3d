If there is one big positive to have come from the fallout from Muhsin Ertugral s resignation as head coach on Wednesday it must be Mhlongo s appointment to be an assistant to caretaker-coach Augusto Palacios along with Bradley Carnell.Mhlongo the former Bafana Mamelodi Sundowns Pirates Bidvest Wits and Platinum Stars star will surely bring the same solidity and comfort to Bucs bench as he did to the back fours of the teams he played for as an intelligent and ultra-sturdy defensive midfielder.The move was announced in a press statement from Pirates on Thursday morning. Orlando Pirates is proud to announce the appointment of Benson Mhlongo as the Club s second Assistant Coach the statement read. The Chairman of Orlando Pirates Dr. Irvin Khoza expressed his delight at giving an opportunity to not only a former Club Captain but most importantly a young South African Coach. The statement quoted Khoza as saying: It is important for us to move on from the disruption that has necessitated the changes made to the Technical Team. To this end we have also brought in Benson Mhlongo as the second Assistant Coach. With the experience of Augusto Palacios and the enthusiasm of our Assistant Coaches Bradley Carnell and Benson Mhlongo I am confident that we have a capable Technical Team that can take this team forward. Mhlongo s appointment brings a positive spin to what might have become a dire situation for Bucs of losing their head coach just seven matches into the Premier Soccer League season.His and former Bafana and VfB Stuttgart left-back Carnell s input along with long-time Bucs development servant and often caretaker Palacios s experience and popularity with the players could make for a technical team well capable of rescuing Pirates season.Bucs are in sixth place in the PSL with four draws and two wins from seven games.Their lone league defeat was the 6-1 humiliation against SuperSport United in Nelspruit on Tuesday night that led to Ertugral s dramatic resignation.- TMG Digital
