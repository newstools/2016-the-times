"I don't see myself as leading the attack," Rabada said yesterday when someone dared suggest that, with Dale Steyn and his fractured shoulder homeward bound, he was where the buck stopped.And well they might have thought so, what with Rabada taking 5/92 to seal South Africa's victory over Australia in the first Test at the WACA by 177 runs."I know that I've got a job to do. Every player has a job to do and so does every other player in the team. So I just try to do my job."I've got a responsibility to make sure I produce the goods for the country. No one wants to lose, right?"Right. Maybe it really is that straightforward. If, that is, you're blessed with the body, talent, technique, skill, mental and physical fortitude and killer instinct that Rabada has by the boatload.All of that and more shimmered in Perth's radiant sunshine in one over to Adam Voges in Australia's second innings on Sunday.The first ball hit Voges high on the pad, the second swung away and beat him, the third was defended to point, the fourth was full outside off and left, and the fifth moved away just enough to take the outside edge of a bat into Quinton de Kock's gloves."I enjoyed that over," Rabada said."It was a new batsman coming in, the ball was reversing nicely and I was feeling my best rhythm. Sometimes you'll get a wicket exactly how you want it and that was one of those times."Time. It's precious and at 21 and only nine Tests into his career he has lots of it.
