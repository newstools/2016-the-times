Speaking at a media briefing on allegations in the public protector's 'State of Capture', Molefe tried to clarify the statement he made the day before when he broke down in tears while trying to explain his movements in Saxonwold the Johannesburg suburb where the Gupta family resides.Cellphone tracking records obtained by the public protector indicate Molefe was near the Guptas' Saxonwold residence 19 times between August 5 and November 17 2015.Yesterday, Molefe denied allegations that he visited the Gupta house in Saxonwold, but did say there was a shebeen 'one or two streets away' from the house. The comment invited the scorn of social media, with many asking one question: Where is the #SaxonwoldShebeen?Now Molefe claims there was misunderstanding, claiming it was his colleague - not him - who frequented the shebeen."I did not say I went there. My colleague said there is a place in Saxonwold that he goes to on Fridays and Saturdays. I did not say I went there to drink," Molefe said.
