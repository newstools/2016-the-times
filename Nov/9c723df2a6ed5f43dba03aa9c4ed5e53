Opening batsman Stephen Cook is intimately acquainted with one of these famous places, and he hopes that will set him up for success at the other in the first Test between Australia and South Africa here tomorrow."The [Waca] wicket comes with a great reputation and we've spoken to guys like Hashim [Amla], who've played here before, and they've given their advice," Cook said yesterday."What holds me in fairly good stead is that the Wanderers is my home ground, and that's probably the one ground in the world that's similar to Perth in terms of pace and bounce."I'll try to take a few of the lessons I've learnt in my career and translate them into playing here."Cook has had 101 of his 329 innings in first-class cricket at the Wanderers, where he averages 39.72 and has scored seven centuries and 20 half-centuries.His overall record in 329 trips to the first-class crease is 12426 runs scored at 41.42 with 38 hundreds and 50 fifties.That doesn't necessarily mean he is a better player when he isn't at home.Rather it could be indicative of how difficult the Wanderers is as a batting venue in the longer format.So there is sense in what Cook said, although he will have to overcome an unhappy habit of nicking off in South Africa's warm-up matches on tour which has limited his scores to five, 12 and nought.But there was another reason for Cook to be cheerful about batting at the Waca.The Proteas have played only three Tests there, drawing the first and winning the next two to start their series success in 2008-2009 and to clinch the 2012-2013 rubber."It's really good to have reference points like that when you arrive at a ground and a number of the guys have good, happy memories," he said."So the young guys have been a bit like a sponge, just taking in information and trying to absorb."Only six of the 16 players in SA's squad have experience of Test cricket in Australia, but none of that half-dozen have yet finished on the losing side in this country.Cook will hope to add his name to that story of success after the first Test.
