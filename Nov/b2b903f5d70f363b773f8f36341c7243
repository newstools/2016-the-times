The ANC finally managed to get most of its caucus to attend a sitting, after two previous votes on the bill failed to muster a quorum.A total of 228 MPs voted for the bill, while 86 voted against it.Mthembu had said failure to pass the bill was "disappointing and embarrassing" and ordered MPs to pitch up yesterday.Mthembu said 40 of the party's 249 MPs had been granted leave of absence for last week's vote. The other 209 had confirmed attendance in the house, he said.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan first tabled the Division of Revenue Amendment Bill three weeks ago, during the medium-term budget policy statement, which provided for a R5.41-billion adjustment to national budgets.ANC caucus spokesman Moloto Mothapo said it was expected that MPs would do their jobs "across all political parties"."A number of MPs were away on international visits and oversight. Those were back today," said Mothapo.DA finance spokesman David Maynier said a third "three-line-whip" had seen the ANC finally manage to form a quorum."The failure to pass the bill, despite two votes, two three-line-whips, and a barrage of text messages begging members to vote, was unprecedented."
