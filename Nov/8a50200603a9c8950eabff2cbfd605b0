Madlala has been acting CEO of the PSL since Brand de Villiers resigned from the post in November 2015. She is also the chairman of PSL club and Maritzburg s Durban-based KwaZulu-Natal neighbours Lamontville Golden Arrows.Call it a conspiracy theory or foolhardiness on the part of the coach for picking fights with powerful people in SA football but being compromised due to his fight with Madlala was the official reason given by Middendorp to United on his departure the source said.Middendorp had allowed himself to become embroiled in an at times direct at others indirect running battle with Madlala in his 11-month tenure at the club since his return there for a third stint in late December 2015.The coach apparently believed this to stem from when Middendorp was fired from coaching Arrows in September 2011 and took Madlala s club to Fifa to force the Durban side to pay out the remainder of his contract.In April Middendorp and Arrows assistant-coach Mandla Ncikazi were involved in an ugly touchline incident just off camera while post-match TV interviews were being conducted in a match at Princess Magogo Stadium where the two apparently pushed each other.Middendorp and United complained afterwards that Madlala had been present and conducting herself in a manner of a chairman of Arrows and not of a neutral PSL CEO.This season Middendorp went on SuperSport s Extra Time post-weekend analysis show to complain about refereeing decisions against his team in their 2-0 defeat against Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on September 24.He had said in his post-match interview that he believed Maritzburg were being targeted for miraculously surviving relegation on the last day of last season at the expense of an establishment club in SA football Jomo Cosmos. We are not getting any decisions. I don t know if everyone is insulted that Jomo Cosmos were relegated and we are now getting punished? Middendorp had questioned.On Robert Marawa s Extra Time again the coach hinted at a conspiracy saying his team would be targeted by referees because he had spoken out. However replays on the show displayed that in fact the refereeing decisions in Maritzburg's game against Chiefs had been correct and the United coach was left with egg on his face.However within a week Middendorp s prediction of being targeted by refs did appear to have some basis to it.The coach again complained when Victor Hlongwane was deployed for his team's 1-0 loss against Polokwane City at Harry Gwala Stadium on September 27 given that Maritzburg had past issues with the referee.Hlongwane had been suspended last season after overseeing a clash between Maritzburg and Polokwane on February 3 where the ref had dubiously awarded a penalty to City and red-carded United defender Brian Onyango.United have not fared poorly under Middendorp this season sitting in ninth place in the PSL from two wins four draws and two defeats in 10 matches. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
