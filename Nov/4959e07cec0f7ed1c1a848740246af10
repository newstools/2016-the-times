The invite reads: "For the last week the twittersphere has been aflood with searches and questions about the infamous Saxonwold Shebeen. Why isn t it on Google Maps? How much is a Johnny Black? Do they serve Gordhan s Gin? Is it bring and bribe? All these questions and more will be answered for the first time when the Saxonwold Shebeen opens its doors to the public".The doors will open at 7pm tomorrow night and entry will cost R6 - that's knocking off some zeroes from the R600 million allegedly promised to a government official.For your rands you will get a beer while a DJ takes to the deck.The cheeky organisers are an electronic music events company that pledges support for the "Green Beings" charity but its not promised to donate all the funds raised by the shebeen shindig.The exact venue remains a secret - for now.Twin Peak Projects states: "Location in Saxonwold will be announced at 4pm on Thursday".Parody accounts and memes have been doing the rounds on social media since Eskom CEO Brian Molefe last week became emotional and appeared to break down in tears while trying to explain his movements in Saxonwold the Johannesburg suburb where the Gupta family resides.His waterworks did not earn any sympathy from the Twitterati. Instead they latched on to Molefe s attempt to make light of the State of Capture findings with his chirp that he might have gone to a shebeen in Saxonwold and #SaxonwoldShebeen has been raising laughter ever since.See more here.
