The party's Day of Action march to call for President Jacob Zuma's resignation was marred by looting vandalism intimidation and violence that resulted in police investigating illegal gathering and alleged incitement by leaders.EFFThe irked mayor said the Tshwane Metro Police Department's approval of the march came with an approved route and guidelines which the EFF defied.The party was granted permission to march from the Church Square to the Pretoria Magistrate's Court but several groups marched throughout the city and ended up outside the Union Buildings where police clashed with protesters trying to gain entry.2 When we approved their request for the march there were guidelines that were given on where they could march and what was allowed and what was not allowed. We do take exception to what happened and we are going to take it up with the (organisation) relevant leadership he said.Msimang said what happened bordered on illegality and that he was going to propose to council that by-laws and policies regulating gatherings be strengthened so that organisations or individuals were held responsible for any kind of damage as a result of march or protest approved in their name.Malema It is something we can take to council and try to strengthen by-laws give them teeth so that we can act against people who participate in things like this he said.Speaking after taking part in the clean-up yesterday Msimang said the cost of damage caused during the march ran into millions of rands and resources had to be taken from other areas of the city's functions to clean up the mess.EFFActing police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane said 28 arrests were made and more arrests in relation to various charges such as malicious damage to property public violence burglary and assault were likely as 35 cases were being investigated.He said two police officers were injured with one a captain having undergone on surgery after he was hit in the face with a bottle. These unfortunate incidents which resulted in members of the service being injured are regrettable and must be condemned by all of us he said.EFF acting spokesperson Fana Mokoena could not be reached for comment.- TMG Digital/The Times
