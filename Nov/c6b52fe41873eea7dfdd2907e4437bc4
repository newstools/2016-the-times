It is understood that more than four global companies and two leading kit manufacturers have pledged to fund the proposal to create "the best club side in world rugby".The new team, which could be operational by 2018, would be based in a new 20000-seater stadium.Ben Ryan, the Englishman who guided Fiji to their first Olympic gold medal in the Sevens final in Rio, Brazil, claims the move would be a "world game-changer".About 19% of professional players worldwide are Pacific Islanders or of Pacific Islands descent. "I believe the impact of this plan would see Fiji win the World Cup one day," said Ryan, who is spearheading the initiative."It is not pie in the sky. Pick a world XV from the players that are playing outside Fiji and Samoa in the other teams and you'd get a team that is there or thereabouts."We have got some of the biggest companies in the world backing this. They have ties with the Pacific Islands. I have had conversations and we have got money on the table to pay for all of this. We will have more money behind the team than any other Super rugby franchise."Ryan, 45, added: "We could make them the best club side in the world. Imagine the talent that we have got in France? They would all be on the first flight back." The plan has yet to be endorsed by Super rugby, but Ryan has outlined the proposals to World Rugby."No one has ever gone to Super rugby and said: 'We would like a franchise in the islands' and we've got more money than any other franchise in Super rugby," he said."Plus, we can build a new stadium that is a 10-minute drive from Nadi Airport and surrounded by 20 five-star hotels." - The Daily Telegraph
