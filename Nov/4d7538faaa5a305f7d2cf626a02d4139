The MPs were also against government moves to ban the sale of booze within a 500m radius of transport hubs or residential areas.They expressed their strong reservations during a meeting with officials from the Department of Trade and Industry, who were briefing them on a new national liquor policy recently published for comment.The policy states that where such outlets already exist within a 500m radius of schools, churches, government buildings and public transport, they will be allowed to continue trading, provided they abide by rules concerning trading hours and noise levels. However, no new licences will be issued in such areas.It also seeks to increase the legal drinking age from 18 to 21 in a bid to prevent alcohol abuse and the damage it costs to the economy.But MPs told officials that, under the proposed policy, no new liquor licences could be issued to supermarkets in residential areas, airports, shopping malls or in densely populated townships.ANC MP Nicolas Koornhof said this would be "almost impossible" in South African cities, while committee chairman Joan Fubbs said it could reinforce apartheid spatial planning by forcing liquor outlets out of densely populated areas like Alexandra and Khayelitsha.MPs also argued that it would be impossible to enforce compliance with the drinking age, if it was raised from 18 to 21.Fubbs said parliament would not adopt "legislation that can't be enforced"."Our concern is not a disagreement with the principle and the goal to reduce the social impact of drinking, but perhaps we should see if that can be achieved without raising the age."We are currently unable to enforce 18, how much money will we need to spend to enforce 21?" she asked.Director for Liquor Law and Policy at DTI, Clementine Makaepea, said alcohol abuse cost the country R37-billion a year in medical bills, crime and road accidents.
