Mashaba was told to stay at home after a verbal altercation with SAFA president Danny Jordaan and guests who came to the team changeroom after the 2-1 World Cup qualifier victory over Senegal in Polokwane on Saturday.The side will instead be led by assistant coach Owen da Gama and is likely to see a number of changes including a probable debut for Dutch-born striker Lars Veldwijk who was an unused substitute on Saturday.The Senegal victory extended Bafana s unbeaten run to 13 matches just two short of their all-time longest unbeaten run of 15 games.That was achieved under coach Clive Barker between September 1994 and January 1996 midway through their successful Nations Cup-winning campaign on home soil.It started with a 1-0 success over Madagascar and ended with a defeat by the same scoreline against Egypt in the final pool match of the Nations Cup finals that Bafana went on to win.If Bafana avoid defeat in Maputo they will edge closer to that mark with their last defeat coming with a C team against Angola in the African Nations Championship qualifiers in October last year.They went down 2-0 on that day with the side led by the second assistant Thabo Senong as the main squad were still making their way back from a Central American tour that finished with a 1-1 draw in Honduras.And so with Mashaba on the touchline Bafana have in fact already passed the record as they are unbeaten in the last 16 games in which he has been in the dugout.The last time he saw his side lose was the 3-1 defeat away in Mauritania in the Nations Cup qualifiers last September.Since the loss to Angola Bafana have won eight and drawn five of their 13 games.That does include three games at the COSAFA Castle Cup in Namibia in June when the Olympic Games-bound Under-23 side and goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse were given full caps for their participation and won the tournament.But all these records will mean little to the players especially Veldwijk who are instead trying to position themselves in the team for the African Nations Cup qualifiers that begin in March and the continuation of the World Cup qualifiers next August.Mozambique are going through a rebuilding phase under flamboyant former Portugal international Abel Xavier.The Mozambique-born ex-defender has returned to his homeland to lead a side that has battled in times as they seek to renew the squad with younger players.Their latest defeat came in a 1-0 friendly loss to Kenya in Nairobi this weekend making four defeats in their last five games.They have also only managed a single goal in that time.Xavier says there was no shame in his side s loss and says the rebuilding is what is most important. Kenya is a strong team and I am not ashamed to lose to them he told reporters. They have a strong side and I am happy with the level of competition we've got in the game. I have always wanted to create a proactive team in Mozambique and I believe we are getting there because I have a good young team made up of players between 19 and 23 years."So these are players who have a big and long future in the team and I am confident in a few years we will be ready to face any team. Bafana have won all five of their previous meetings with Mozambique scoring 13 goals and conceding three in the process. - TMG Digital
