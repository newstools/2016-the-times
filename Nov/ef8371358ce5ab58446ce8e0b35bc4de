 Rape culture at universities should be dealt with and eliminated. Our universities should not be centres of despair and torture for women said committee chair Connie September.Wits management on Thursday officially confirmed that a female student was raped by another student at the Wits Junction residence in Parktown three weeks ago.That came after students accused the institution of protecting the alleged rapist saying that when the victim reported the matter to residence management and security they protected the alleged perpetrator. If indeed this allegation is true the law must take its course over and above the university's disciplinary proceedings. The perpetrator should be brought to book September said.She said the committee will write to the Higher Education and Training Minister Dr Blade Nzimande and Wits vice-chancellor Prof Adam Habib so that the matter can be speedily investigated . This phenomenon is prevalent at many other universities too. All people especially women should and must feel safe wherever they are September added.Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel said the university has worked with the complainant for the last few weeks and the nature of this engagement is confidential . We urge everyone to respect the confidentiality and integrity of the complainant who is our first priority " she said.It is believed the female student tried to commit suicide allegedly because management ignored her plea and allowed the suspected rapist to remain on campus as he was writing exams.She has apparently left the country and dropped out of the institution.Patel said the matter was currently being investigated by the Gender Equity Office in line with the University s Sexual Harassment Sexual Assault and Rape Policy. We hope that the confidentiality with which we are managing this complaint serves as evidence that we will be responsive to every individual complainant in need. We urge anyone who has been the victim of gender based harm at Wits to report these incidents immediately to the Gender Equity Office " added Patel.Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela said they were alerted to the rape on Wednesday night when a group of students confronted Wits management and accused them of protecting the perpetrator. - TMG Digtial
