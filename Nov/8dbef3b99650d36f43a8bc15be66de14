Tinyiko Elphas Khosa, 52, who turned himself over to the police on Tuesday, faces a charge of theft after allegedly leaking maths paper 2.Copies of the paper were circulated among a few pupils in Limpopo and Gauteng.He is expected back in court on Wednesday for a bail application.Khosa, who owns the New Era College and Mudzahisi College, both in the Malamulele area, turned himself in at the Giyani police station following weeks of investigations by the Hawks and the Department of Basic Education.It is not known whether pupils at his colleges were involved in the leaking.Limpopo Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said: "We have a strong case against [Khosa]."We believe that more [people] are to be arrested."The department discovered the security breach on October 31 at Giyani High School.Some pupils confessed to seeing the question paper before the examination. The leak was first traced to a source in Gauteng.But the focus was back on Limpopo after statements were taken from several people.Spokesman for the Department of Basic Education Elijah Mhlanga said further investigations would establish the number of pupils who had access to the question paper before the examination.He said the department would take disciplinary action against pupils implicated in the leak."A rewrite is something that we do when there is large number of learners involved and we are not sure how many and where they are," he said. Mhlanga said a group of pupils in Gauteng shared the question paper with others in Limpopo through the WhatsApp social media service.He said investigations would also shed light on which other schools were implicated.Last year a life sciences question paper was leaked in Limpopo.Pupils in the Vhembe district had to rewrite the exam .This prompted the department to introduce an automated security system to reduce the risk of question papers being leaked.
