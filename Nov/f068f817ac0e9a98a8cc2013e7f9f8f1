Sushi king tweeted the minister stating "The rumour that @Derek_Hanekom has two passports SA n German is worrying. If true then he's unPatriotic n can't hold public office..."He did not elaborate on the source of the rumour.Hanekom still in the ANC meeting which got extended to Monday responded politely - even trying to pre-empt any possible confusion involving countries starting with a "G" when he was an anti-apartheid activist in exile.I still have a Ghanaian passport that was issued to me in Harare in 1988. I think it has expired. No German passport https://t.co/e9TFa0Gtk4The timing of the "unpatriotic" attack was questioned and condemned by social media users who slammed the controversial Sushi King club owner."@Derek_Hanekom To think that you have to defend yourself against convicted criminals! @Kenny_T_Kunene " Mbathane Matshaya @Sir_Bu commented."Is this issue now coming up because the minister is speaking up against JZ?
