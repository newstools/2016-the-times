Protesters intend to continue the sit-in indefinitely until Minister Senzeni Zokwana addresses their concerns.The department did not respond to queries. However, a source said the department was concerned because most protesters were old and women.By late yesterday the minister was yet to arrive and it was unclear whether he would do so.One protester, Gilberts Kido, said the action came on the back of a seven-day hunger strike by five people, which was suspended on Tuesday.Kido hopes the sit-in will increase pressure on the government to accommodate their demands."The people are tired of hearing promises," Kido said."So they decided that this is a now-or-never action, and it will continue indefinitely until these demands are met. It very well [could last days]."Kido said fishermen, processors, and divers were gathered to advocate for small-scale fisheries, adding the minister made certain promises about allocating fishing rights but nothing had materialised.Gavin Roberts, a fisherman from Jeffreys Bay, said large companies monopolised the seas, leaving small fisheries in increasingly impoverished conditions."The government must take notice of the Eastern Cape - it's a poverty-stricken area," he said. "From here, moving forward we will just be more militant."Police were monitoring the sit-in. Kido said protesters were given specific instructions not to injure people or damage infrastructure.
