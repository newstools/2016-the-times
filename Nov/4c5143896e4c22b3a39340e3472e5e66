Veldwijk who is eligible to play for Bafana through his father who was born in South Africa has never represented SA and coach Ephraim Shakes Mashaba by his own admission hopes that the big striker can solve the national team s long-running goal scoring problems.Bafana team manager Barney Kujane who is responsible for the national team s logistics confirmed to Times Media Digital on Monday afternoon that the Dutch-born striker is in camp and he joined several other players who have been arriving in dribs and drabs since Saturday. (Holland-based) Thulani Serero arrived on Saturday while Lars and (Belgium-based) Andile Jali arrived on Sunday Kujane said. (Romania-based) May Mahlangu and (Belgium-based) Ayanda Patosi joined the camp on Monday. Kujane said the Kaizer Chiefs Supersport United and Mamelodi Sundowns players are still en route to Polokwane after playing for their clubs in Telkom Knockout quarterfinal matches at the weekend. The coach (Mashaba) will definitely have his full squad at training tomorrow and we are happy because this is a tough match Kujane said.Bafana are two points behind leaders Senegal in Group D and Mashaba himself said he intends to take the fight to the West Africans at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane if his charges are to close the gap in the 2018 World Cup qualifying group.Bafana could only manage a 1-1 draw with Burkina Faso in their opening World Cup qualifier last month and the addition of Veldwijk who recently joined top- flight Belgian side Kortrijk to the squad signals Mashaba s intention to do just that.Veldwijk has sparked massive curiosity and many local fans have taken to social media wondering out aloud if the big 25-year-old is the goal scoring answer Bafana have been searching for.South African Football Association president Danny Jordaan is happy that Mashaba has handed a maiden call-up to Veldwijk as the striker s inclusion is in line with his demand that the net must be cast wider and beyond South Africa s borders when Bafana squads are selected.Mashaba will be asked to visit all South African players around the world after the Saturday s encounter and Jordaan expects him to have spoken to all overseas-based players by the time Bafana play their next 2018 World Cup qualifier next year. We have a high number of players playing around the world Jordaan told Times Media Digital last week. So in those few months [between the qualifier against Senegal and the next one away to Cape Verde in August next year] the coach will have to go to Europe. He must go visit and see all the players. He must talk to them engage them he must go and then make up his mind about the squad that will face the next challenges next year. Bafana beat Senegal 1-0 through a lone strike from Mpho Makola in their last meeting in the Nelson Mandela Challenge at Orlando Stadium in September last year.But Saturday s meeting is expected to be a tad different given the star-studded visitors lineup that includes Liverpool's Sadio Mane Cheikhou Kouyate of West Ham United Stoke City's Mame Biram Diouf and Lazio s Keita Balde Diao among others.After Saturday s World Cup qualifier Bafana will face Mozambique in an international friendly match in Maputo next Tuesday.Bafana Bafana squad:Goalkeepers: Williams Khune Mhlongo; Defenders: Mphahlele Coetzee Hlatshwayo Daniels Mbekile Langerman Mathoho Matlaba; Midfielders: Furman Jali Mahlangu Patosi Dolly Klate Makola Kekana; Strikers: Rodgers Grobler Veldwijk Vilakazi Serero Phala - TMG Digital
