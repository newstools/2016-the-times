The 30-year-old was the marquee signing of the last transfer window for the newly-formed Premier Soccer League franchise but failed to find the back of the net in his first nine games for the team. His all-round performance was energetic though and not a cause of concern for City coach Eric Tinkler. The coach though does admit he was relieved for the player s sake when Majoro finally broke his duck against Bloemfontein Celtic earlier this month. That was followed immediately by another goal in the 4-3 Telkom Knockout quarterfinal victory at Baroka FC the first time Majoro had managed to score in consecutive games since banging in five in a row for Orlando Pirates almost two years ago. He deserved it it hasn t been from a lack of effort. He s worked extremely hard. He has that intelligence. Hopefully it s the start of many for him Tinkler said. Majoro is likely to lead the line again when City travel to Chippa United on Saturday the focal-point for his fellow attacking midfielders such as on-form Lebogang Manyama and Aubrey Ngoma. The former Bafana international has faced the Chilli Boyz just twice before in his career netting for Kaizer Chiefs after coming on at half time in a 2-0 win in 2012 before another subs' appearance this time in the colours of Pirates ended up in a 1-0 loss in 2014. City could be top of the league by Saturday evening if they win and other results go their way which would be a huge boost in confidence for a side many had predicted would struggle this season and for whom retaining their top-flight status remains the number one priority. Majoro has always been a striker who has scored his goals in batches and if he can go on a similar run City will continue to surprise perhaps even with a first cup final as they take on Free State Stars in the Telkom Knockout semifinals at home on November 26. - TMG Sport
