When I woke up this morning I realised I had received an email at 3.30am form the coach. Khoza read out the brief email he had received from Ertugral. I feel sorry and regret not being able to turn around [the team s form], the coach said in the email.Khoza said: When I read his letter I was left with no option. He added: Yesterday s result was a big shock. Unfortunately between the coach and us I cannot disclose the terms of our parting. We wish him well wherever he is going, but I would have loved if he had engaged me first before expressing his frustration, Khoza said. Because you will remember whenever we part with coaches it is always in dignified manner.
