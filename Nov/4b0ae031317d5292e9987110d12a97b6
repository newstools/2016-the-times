It was widely reported by Sunday papers in 2011 that the minister, a married father of two, had a brief tryst with Joyce Omphemetse Molamu, a North West model, after a function in Houghton.That evening he accompanied Joyce to a Joburg apartment where the first of two alleged sexual encounters took place, according to reports.After initially denying the affair through his lawyers, Fikile made a dramatic u-turn when he apologised for bedding the model and further accused the woman of trying to extort money from him in return for her silence.Speaking to Anele Mdoda on Real Talk recently, Fikile, once again spoke out about the incident, in which he clarified that Joyce was not his girlfriend at the time."It is always reported that she is my girlfriend. You know a girlfriend? It is someone who is steady, you go out with, you go to the movies, and even if you cheat, you are always loyal to her. And then you get caught," he said.He further revealed that his encounter with Joyce was a "one-night stand" and that he still regrets it."This thing was a one-night stand, and it happened just like that. It so happens that I regret that," he explained."And I wanted to defend myself against it, and somebody said to me (ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe)...'If you have done something wrong, just admit, and apologise, because you've done something wrong. You're a married man.'"It was only after receiving Gwede's advice that he decided to own up to his actions and apologise. He claimed he bought his wife a diamond to say sorry.You can watch the full interview here: Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
