According to a study led by employer brand management Universum, the gender-based pay gap still exists.The survey shows that young professional women - with a business or commerce background - in South Africa earn R80218 less per annum than their male counterparts. Those with an engineering or technology background have a gender pay gap of R39504.This is according to figures shared by respondents working in those fields.Human resources expert Terry Taylor says that while the salary gap is closing in South Africa, the figures are still about 15%.She says: "I've had experience of pay gaps of 10%-15%, but this is dependent on the industry."Taylor explains that while it was difficult to do comparisons, there are countries where the gap is "as low as a 2% differential whereas others are as high as 35%".She says that in South Africa, the revised Employment Equity Act is helping in addressing the differentials given the "equal work for equal pay" principle.Anita Bosch, a professor in the department of industrial psychology and people management at the University of Johannesburg , edited The SA Board for People Practices 2015 report on the gender pay gap in South Africa.Bosch says that although women-headed households far outnumber those headed by males, there is still gender disparity in work remuneration."Women's income is still seen as 'jam' money," she says, "even though women in lower income brackets have no choice regarding work."Bosch adds that "feminised" work - that involves skills like care and nurturing - is undervalued by the market. "We see it in psychology, teaching, nursing and care-giving. As soon as a profession is seen as feminine, even if it is undertaken by some men, its economic value falls."TOP EMPLOYERSUNIVERSUM's survey was to determine what the best global employers are doing to convince workers to join and stay with them.
