Yesterday the South African cricket captain was fined all of his match fee from last week's Test victory over Australia. He was also given three "penalty points" to add to his disciplinary record. He was found guilty of "changing the condition of the ball" using an artificial substance - in this case a mint that led to the Australian media, predictably, dubbing the issue "Lollygate".It was Du Plessis's second offence after he was convicted of ball-tampering against Pakistan during a Test in 2013. On the face of it, Du Plessis comes across as a recidivist; instead, others should be hanging their heads in shame.The International Cricket Council, for one. It has been unable to prosecute a single, more heinous, case of match-fixing, so it pursues gum-chewers caught on camera.Cricket SA believes that it can control the media in Australia as it does at home, where any individual challenging it is immediately blacklisted, as has happened to at least two renowned local cricket journalists.When it failed to impose its "media protocol" on an Australian reporter attempting to get a comment from Du Plessis while the players were in a public space, Cricket SA resorted to using one of its goons to restrain the person. The goon involved is lucky he was not asked to help the local constabulary with their inquiries into physical assault.Cricket SA has little understanding of how the media works, or how to deal with it elsewhere. Allowing Du Plessis to issue a firm, if non-committal, response to the inquiring reporter would have quickly defused an issue which has now embarrassed the team.Instead of showing up the ICC prosecution of Du Plessis for what it really was, a petty act, Cricket SA has itself emerged as small-minded and thuggish.
