Brent Lucas, 53, lost the 56-year-old family heirloom, an 18-carat gold wedding band, when he washed his hand in the sea while fishing.The ring, that has "Tom and Lyn" and their wedding date in 1960 engraved on its inside and "Brent and Peggy" with the year 1991 on the outside, belonged to his parents."I never thought one day someone would find it," said Lucas.Three weeks ago La Lucia businessman Donald Ensor found the ring while scouring the beachfront for treasure with his metal detector.Facebook posts of Ensor's find caught the attention of Lucas' stepdaughter, Jolene Burns, who showed it to Lucas.On Tuesday Lucas and Ensor made contact."Brent gave me enough information to believe he was the rightful owner," said Ensor.Lucas said he would make his way to Durban from Kosi Bay on the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast on Monday to collect the ring."Jolene had seen the post and saw the names. She had no idea I had lost a ring. She showed me the story and picture and I could not believe it," he said.Lucas said the ring, which belonged to his mother, Lynette Lucas, was passed on to him when his father died."I had given it to my ex-wife. When we divorced I asked for it back because of its sentimental value. When I lost it I didn't have the heart to tell my mother, but I called her on Tuesday and told her the story and the good news."Lucas said finding the ring meant it was destined to stay with the family. "I would like to pass it on to one of my children."
