Molefe announced his resignation on Friday with effect from 1 January next year.His resignation follows a report by the public protector s "State of Capture" report released earlier this month which made observations about the conduct of Eskom in awarding questionable coal supply contracts to Gupta-owned Tegeta Resources and Exploration. Mr Molefe has been instrumental in developing Eskom s turnaround strategy which is beginning to yield positive results and it is disappointing that he will not be present to see it to complete fruition Brown said in a statement.She said as a shareholder representative she would work closely with the Eskom board to ensure that the company remained stable. I am confident that Mr Molefe leaves a strong executive team in place to continue to deliver on Eskom s mandate and implementation of the turnaround strategy.The Democratic Alliance welcomed Molefe s resignation.It said it would be laying charges against Molefe in terms of the Public Finance Management Act and the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act.DA spokeswoman on public enterprises Natasha Mazzone said the party had requested that the Parliament s Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises summon Molefe as a matter of urgency so that he could tell the truth under oath about his relationship with the Guptas. It is suspicious that he has resigned after we began the process of getting him to come clean under oath in parliament. The DA saw Molefe s resignation as the first step in recovering Eskom s damaged integrity.Mazzone said Molefe s head was the first to roll following the explosive State of Capture report in which he was implicated as one of various Zuma allies with ties to the Gupta family.
