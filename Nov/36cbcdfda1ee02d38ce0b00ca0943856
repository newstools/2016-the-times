Home Affairs director-general Mkuseli Apleni at a briefing in Pretoria said he will depart on Tuesday evening and that the charges levelled against him will be withdrawn in his absence.The artist born Dante Terrell Smith was arrested in January in Cape Town when he tried leaving South Africa using a World Government of World Citizens passport which is not recognised by local authorities.He reportedly entered the country with a US passport and his visitor's visa was valid until February. His family's visas allegedly expired in 2014 and he was accused of illegally helping them to stay in the country.Bey previously appeared in the Bellville Magistrate's Court on charges relating to contraventions of the Immigration Act.Though Bey apologised for his error it is not enough to keep him in the country. For his conduct Mr Smith Bey will be declared an undesirable person by the Director-General of Home Affairs in terms of Section 30 on the Immigration Act of 2002. He will therefore not qualify for a port of entry visa or admission to the republic Apleni said.Bey may apply for a waiver.The Home Affairs announcement comes less than a week after the hip-hop artist joined the line-up of South Africa's new online radio station The Eye.Bey and producer Ferrari Sheppard debuted their first show last week.The World Government of World Citizens was established in 1953 by peace activist Garry Davis who renounced his US citizenship after World War 2. He died in 2013.
