It will be a sweet victory for coach Pitso Mosimane after Abafana Be'sthende took four points from Sundowns last season, winning away from home in the first half match before holding the Brazilians to a goalless draw in the corresponding fixture earlier this year.The match started on a rather pedestrian pace but Sundowns soon found their groove and started bossing possession, pinning the visitors in their own half.Following a lucklustre opening half hour of football, Sundowns started to look more threatening each time they got the ball in the final third and scored late in the first half to take the lead through the boot of captain Hlompho Kekana, 1-0.Mosimane's charges caught the visitors cold just after the restart and doubled their lead courtesy of a fortuitous Sibusiso Vilakazi goal, 2-0.The off-season multi-million signing from Bidvest Wits, Vilakazi, will be thoroughly pleased as it was his second goal in as many matches having netted the winner in Sundowns clinical 2-1 win over arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs at the same venue at the weekend.Already 2-0 down, Arrows, who had very little to offer and looked nowhere near the energetic side that won their mid-week match at Highlands Park, pushed numbers forward in a bid to reduce their deficit.Clinton Larsen' side paid the price with 15 minutes remaining Sundowns scored their third goal and ended the match as a contest.Midfield livewire Percy Tau made a storming run down the left flank and put in a delightful low cross, which eluded the Arrows defence and found Themba Zwane at the far post for an easy tap in to make it 3-0.Sundowns moved up to 8th position on the log table with 10 points. The Brazilians are 10 points behind joint leaders Wits and Cape Town City but have only played five matches. City have played 10 matches, two less than Wits.Despite the defeat, Arrows are sitting comfortable in 4th place with 17 points, behind third-place SuperSport United only on goal difference. United won a crucial point away at Kaizer Chiefs following a 1-1 draw at FNB Stadium.Dennis Onyango was hardly troubled in the Down's goal in both halves. Arrows staged a late rally to pull one back but were never allowed back into match.Other mide-week results:Tuesday, November 22, 2016:Chippa United 0 - 1 Orlando PiratesCape Town City 3 - 2 Martizburg UnitedPlatinum Stars 2 - 3 Ajax Cape TownWednesday, November 23, 2016:Kaizer Chiefs 1 - 1 SuperSport UnitedMamelodi Sundowns 3 - 0 Golden ArrowsBloemfontein Celtic 2 - 1 Baroka FC Bidvest Wits 2 - 2 Highlands ParkPolokwane City 1 - 0 Free State Stars- TMG Digital- TMG Digital
