Adriaan Strauss, the captain in all nine Tests so far this year, will be rested with the Springboks sticking to traditional practice by not awarding caps for a fixture against the invitational side.Coetzee, who is due to name his matchday 23 on Thursday, said: "Patrick was always part of the leadership group and part of the spine of the Springbok team."He has excelled as a leader at franchise level and has the respect of his peers," the coach added of the Sharks stalwart, whose Test career has seen him operate at fullback and flyhalf."He understands the team culture and has a great understanding of the game and the way we want to play. I have no doubt that he will make a success of his appointment as captain for this match."Turning to Strauss, Coetzee said the hooker would return to skipper the side against England at Twickenham on November 12."Adriaan still plays an important role in the squad by giving support to Patrick and also helping Bongi Mbonambi and Malcolm Marx with technical detail," the coach explained.Lambie, who has scored 137 points in 53 Test matches, called the captaincy "a big honour"."South Africa has a proud rugby tradition and the whole squad are excited to represent our country against the Barbarians," he said.South Africa arrived in England following a torrent of criticism.They have lost five of their nine Tests this year with a nine-try 57-15 thrashing by world champions New Zealand in Durban provoking much heartache in a rugby nation that has traditionally rivalled the All Blacks for global supremacy.Coetzee, who succeeded Heyneke Meyer last year after a World Cup in which the Springboks came within three points of beating New Zealand in a gripping semifinal, has found himself in the firing line over his team selections.The Springboks and their coach could do with a winning record on a tour which, after the two matches in London, concludes with Tests against Italy and Wales. The Baa-Baas will be playing the green and gold for the eighth time since 1952 this weekend and they lead the Springboks 4-3.
