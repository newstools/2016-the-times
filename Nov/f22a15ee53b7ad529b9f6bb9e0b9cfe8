In a new teaser clip for the BBC s upcoming sequel to its legendary documentary series narrated by Sir David Attenborough, we see a hatchling iguana dodging death on what appears to be an island full of snakes.The poor baby iguana is just going about his business on the Gal pagos Islands when a racer snake sneaks up behind it. The iguana hot-foots it away only for what seems like an army of snakes to explode out of the rocks and sand in an ambush scene not unlike a 'Game of Thrones' episode. The scene has been described by some as 'the greatest TV moment ever': Planet Earth II was incredible last night. Although I'm sure my next anxiety dream will include racer snakes. Just catching up on Planet Earth 2. Holy cow that was intense! Iguanas and racer snakes were absolutely mad. #PlanetEarth2 Iguana run on Planet Earth was better than any James Bond movie in my opinion #PlanetEarth2 Amazing footage: a hatchling sea iguana makes a run for its life to the safety of the shore, but will it escape the runner snakes? pic.twitter.com/c9zIhyed4y First the cheating penguin wife and now this iguana running from snakes. Its been an emotional ass week in the Animal Kingdom. If today is my last day on this earth, at least I spent it watching that iguana/snake video 25 times in a row.
