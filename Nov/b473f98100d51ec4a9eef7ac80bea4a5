General secretary Irvin Jim said Numsa was disgusted by the decision taken by the Congress of SA Trade Unions Central Executive Committee (Cosatu) to endorse Ramaphosa to take over as leader of the ANC and that it will be campaigning and lobbying to influence ANC structures to support its call .The trade union federation had on Thursday said: The Cosatu central executive committee resolves to support Cyril Ramaphosa to take over the reins as the next president of the ANC... The ANC leadership to be elected must have a commitment to fight against corruption and also unify the movement."Jim slammed the decision saying: Numsa has already put on record its view that Cyril Ramaphosa is an enemy of the working class.Cosatu: Cyril s our man He has consistently attacked workers' hard-won gains and defended the interests of the exploiting capitalist class most recently when he supported legislation to maintain poverty wages and the super-exploitation of black and African labour under the disguise of national minimum wage at a level which will leave millions of workers in wage-slavery. Worst of all as a director of Lonmin he was directly implicated in the massacre of 34 Marikana workers who demanded a living wage of R12500. By now announcing a national minimum wage of R3500 he is spitting on the graves of those workers who suffered exploitation until the oppressive agents of the capitalist state took their lives. He added that an ANC-led government under Ramaphosa will continue to consolidate the power of white monopoly capitalism and to reassure credit ratings agencies that South Africa is a good place to invest and exploit our natural resources and cheap labour .
