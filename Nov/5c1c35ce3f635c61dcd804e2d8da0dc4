The T20 Franchise Cup begins tomorrow with a double header at the Wanderers.Knights v Cape Cobras - 1pmKieron Pollard could be a much-needed tonic for the Cape Cobras outfit.The Cobras were terribly disappointing in the Sunfoil Series.Highveld Lions v Titans - 6pmWhether this game takes place will be up to the weather gods.This will be an interesting tussle between sides who could not quite force a result in their Sunfoil Series clash over the weekend because of rain.Geoff Toyana and Mark Boucher have settled sides that are well-stocked with proven performers.Sunday:Dolphins v Warriors - 2.30pm at KingsmeadThis pair of perennial under-performers will be looking to get off to a good start, but again their game could be dependent on the elements.Durban has the propensity of remaining dry until there is cricket to be played.Grant Morgan has moulded a good side, while Malibongwe Maketa's team has shown signs of brilliance interspersed with moments of madness.They will need more of the former, especially having the bulk of the Eastern Province side that won the Africa T20 Cup.
