The NSRI's Hartbeespoort station commander, Rod Pitter, yesterday said: "There is a lot of speculation. [While] it is for the SAPS to investigate [the cause], I can say that the rumour that it was a kitchen gas fire [that caused the accident] is not true."The Prime Time caught alight on Saturday afternoon with roughly 200 people on board.A woman died on the boat after she was trapped in a bathroom at the back of the boat, where the fire started. Three others drowned when a rescue boat capsized.Investigators from the SA Maritime Safety Authority, police and the fire department began their investigation yesterday.Authority spokesman Tebogo Ramatjie said investigators had begun to interview witnesses to establish the fire's cause."Initial investigations indicate that the vessel caught fire in the aft, where the kitchen, bathrooms and engines are situated," he said.Ramatjie said the vessel's local general safety certificate was valid until July next year.Meanwhile on Saturday night in a separate incident, another cruise boat, the Party Boat, became marooned on Hartbeespoort Dam after a fishing net became entangled in one of its propellers as it returned to shore.Sarien Pienaar, one of Party Boat's owners, said: "When we were heading out onto the water the first propeller got a fishnet stuck in it, but we kept going."On our way back the second propeller became entangled in a fishnet. The boat's engine seized after that."She said rescuers from the NSRI, police and a private boat owner also became entangled in the net while trying to help them.Pitter said it was a particular problem because illegal fishermen left behind nets in certain parts of the dam. - Additional reporting Julia Madibogo.
