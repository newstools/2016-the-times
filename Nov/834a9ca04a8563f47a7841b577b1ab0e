Provided there are no clouds and not too much light pollution, people should be able to see Earth's satellite loom unusually large over the horizon shortly after sunset, irrespective of where in the world they are.This happens when the Moon is full at the same time as, or very near, perigee -- its closest point to Earth on an elliptical, monthly orbit."On November 14, it becomes full within about two hours of perigee -- arguably making it an extra-super Moon," NASA says on its website.The orbit itself is changeable, meaning the distance from Earth differs from perigee to perigee -- this time it will be the closest since 1948 at a distance of 356,509 kilometres.The average is 384,400km.On Monday, the full Moon's relative proximity should make it appear about 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than at its furthest orbit point, according to the Irish Astronomical Association (IAA)."Because the Earth/Moon system will be getting quite close to the time of year when it is closest to the Sun (January 4, 2017), the Moon will be receiving more sunlight than average, also boosting its apparent brightness."Furthermore, the Moon's position in the sky will mean its southern hemisphere, the brighter of the two, will be turned towards Earth, said the IAA.Without foreknowledge, one might barely notice that the Moon appears brighter than usual, astronomers say. Once it is high in the sky, it would be hard to tell that the Moon is larger.But on the horizon, it could be quite spectacular."When you look at the Moon when it's rising, there is this optical illusion where it looks bigger," astronomer Mark Bailey, emeritus director of the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland, said.Lying low, as a backdrop to trees or buildings for context, our satellite appears larger to the human eye despite being the same size the whole night.Supermoons are actually quite common -- there is one every 14 months on average."But some supermoons are more super than others," said Pascal Descamps of the Paris Observatory -- the closer the Earth the more so."If you want to try to image it, choose a location where you'll get some nice terrestrial feature in the foreground: a well-known landmark such as a tower or a spire will provide a nice comparison, particularly if you stay back a bit and use a zoom or telephoto lens which will magnify both objects," added the IAA.The supermoon will also mean a stronger high tide, something that gets surfers giddy with excitement, not only at the prospect of riding bigger waves, but doing so at night.The next comparable event will be in 2034, when the Moon will come even closer, by 64km, to Earth.What about South Africa?Constant Volschenk of the Wits Planetarium has warned that the moon probably won t look that impressive in South Africa, pointing out that it won t be like a big spotlight in the sky. Tana Joseph of the South African Astronomical Observatory said, The supermoon will only look slightly (less than 10%) bigger than an average full moon. So it won't appear nearly as spectacular as something like an eclipse. According to ScienceAlert the moon will be at its biggest at 15:32 GMT which means the best time to see it will be during daylight hours.The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) warned of rough sea conditions strong rip currents and higher tides as the super full moon spring tide takes effect from Thursday.The NSRI s Craig Lambinon explained that the spring tide happens twice every month at full moon and at new moon but it will have a greater affect on the coastline because the full moon this month will be closer to earth than normal - known as a super moon .It lasts for a few days over each full moon and each new moon peaking on the day of the full moon and the new moon he said. From today Thursday 10th November - peaking on Monday 14th November - and lasting until at least Friday 18th November - over this period of time the public anglers bathers beach strollers boaters paddlers and coastline hikers are advised to exercise extreme caution around the coastline Lambinon added.Lambinon also reported that NSRI s Simonstown and Kommetjie duty crews on Thursday assisted with the flooding of roads and residences on Kommetjie Road Sun Valley where a water mains burst causing flooding of the roadway and flooding of some of the residences .The crews used water extrication pumps to assist Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services the Department of Water and Sanitation Disaster Management and CMR (Cape Medical Response) who were all on the scene assisting with local residents . The burst water pipe has been closed and after water was pumped free from residences and the roadway no further assistance is required.
