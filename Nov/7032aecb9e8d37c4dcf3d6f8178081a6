Joseph Plekenpol's 24-year sentence for beating Louis Eksteen to death after rejecting a sexual advance was reduced to 18 years by the Supreme Court of Appeal last week.The court was told that Plekenpol, 31, left school after completing Grade 8 and became a prostitute.He was convicted of murdering Eksteen, 45, in 2013, He delivered a number of fatal blows to Eksteen's head using a knobkierie during a drug and alcohol-fuelled rage.He told the court that the two of them had been taking drugs and drinking alcohol at Eksteen's Pretoria home when the older man suggested they have sex.After ignoring the suggestion, Plekenpol said that Eksteen took his arm, which he interpreted as an advance and led him to react.Plekenpol beat Eksteen before tying him up and stealing his car and wallet.Eksteen was found dead by his mother and two guards.In his judgment Judge Ronnie Pillay said although the offence required more than the prescribed minimum sentence, 24 years was excessive."In balancing all of the favourable factors as against the aggravating factors.I have come to the conclusion that 24 years' imprisonment is indeed shockingly inappropriate," he said."In my view a sentence of 18 years' imprisonment would strike a balance between the nature and gravity of the offences, the interests of society and the personal circumstances of [Plekenpol]."
