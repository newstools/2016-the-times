Madonsela said the investigation had proven that the extent of issues it needed to traverse and resources necessary to execute it were incapable of being executed fully by the public protector. The Constitution says the president has the powers entrusted by the Constitution and is responsible for the appointing commissions of inquiry. Phephelaphi Dube the director of the Centre for Constitutional Rights said there were two issues at play in this regard. "The first being that in the Nkandla matter - the president said that he had not appointed a commission of enquiry because he would have then have had to select a judge to preside over the enquiry and this would create an impression of bias. "So in order to avoid that same challenge being raised the public protector has tried to provide a solution by side-stepping the president having to select his own judge by-passing that responsibility over to the chief justice." Dube said the courts had also said in the Simelane and Mdluli matters that the exercise of public power had to be governed by lawfulness rationality and good faith as was required by the principle of legality. "This means that the president would have to show good cause as to why he shouldn t abide by the recommendations bearing in mind again that the Nkandla decision said the public protector s findings are binding. "Even if establishing commissions of enquiry is a presidential prerogative he does not have unfettered discretion in how this power is exercised."
