The state-owned airline carried 159000 fewer passengers - a 4% decline - compared with its budget due to the entry into the local market of two new low-cost carriers and the fact that foreign airlines such as Emirates, Ethiopian and Qatar are flying direct to Durban and Cape Town, which neutralised domestic fares.However, Nhantsi said the loss in revenue was compensated for by R1-billion in cost savings, particularly on fuel.All in all SAA was pleased with the performance in the second quarter compared to the performance of the last year's second quarter, Nhantsi said.Revenue in the second quarter rose by 5%, with average fares 16% higher than the same period in 2015, though interest costs of R288-million were 41% higher.A bottom-line loss of R765-million was suffered compared with a budgeted R61-million loss.Foreign exchange losses for the period amounted to R592-million, Nhantsi noted.Earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of R206-million were achieved, lower than the budgeted R221-million but a better performance than for the same period last year.In the year to end-March SAA made a R1.5-billion loss, an improvement on the prior year's R5.6-billion.SAA low-cost subsidiary Mango made a R37-million loss in the year to end-March, a dramatic reversal from the R38-million profit it made the previous year.Mango's financial results, which are normally consolidated and hidden in its parent company's statements, were released for the first time to the finance committee after persistent pressure by DA deputy finance spokesman Alf Lees.The loss came on a revenue growth to R2.3-billion from R2.2-billion in 2014-2015.Allegations have been made that Mango's loss was due its being squeezed in a number of ways by SAA, but SAA chairman Dudu Myeni would not comment on this ahead of the briefing, referring all media queries to Mango chairman Rashid Wally.Mango has total assets of R868-million and total liabilities of R585-million.Wally said in the annual report distributed to the committee that the airline's financial performance was "not pretty but I believe our future remains rosy".
