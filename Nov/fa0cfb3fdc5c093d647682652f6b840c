The Johannesburg Labour Court early in September declared Rabelani Tshimomola's dismissal unfair and unprocedural and ordered his reinstatement."The applicant is reinstated to the employ of the department on the same terms and conditions as at the date of dismissal, without loss of benefit," reads part of the order.The department says it will challenge the judgment.Tshimomola blew the whistle on fraud and corruption that cost the department millions in 2014.In his affidavit, Tshimomola also alleged that after blowing the whistle he was threatened and had to hire bodyguards.Mbulelo Musi, a spokesman for the department, said: "Immediately upon learning of the default judgment the department filed papers to have the decision rescinded."Tshimomola's attorney, Moses Nemaxwi, said his client's "house and cars were damaged and he survived several attempts on his life".The judge said that Tshimomola's disclosure should have been protected under the Protected Disclosures Act.
