So said auditor-general Kimi Makwetu at the release of his 2015-2016 audit outcomes report on provincial and national government departments.The AG found that irregular expenditure had increased by almost 40% since 2013-2014 to R46.36-billion.The report singled out continued non-compliance with supply-chain management legislation as the main reason for the increase."When people know that embarrassing and difficult evidence will surface through an audit, they try all manner of games to try to get around that reality. It includes pressure that may be subtle; it also includes direct [bribery]," Makwetu said.Earlier this month the DA laid charges against three officials in the Gauteng department of sports, arts, culture and recreation for allegedly trying to bribe the AG's office to remove audit findings on irregular expenditure. The party said the charges were based on two affidavits disclosed by former MEC Molebatsi Bopape.Makwetu said "when we start focusing our attention on issues that are likely to cause significant risk of financial mismanagement, we are going to attract attention".Members of parliament's standing committee on public accounts want harsher punishment of public officials who break the law.Committee chairman Vincent Smith said the committee was lobbying to strengthen the powers of the AG to match those of other Chapter 9 institutions and enable him to go beyond making mere recommendations.He said parliament was frustrated by the lack of "consequences" for financial mismanagement.The audit report said six state entities were responsible for more than half of the irregular expenditure in 2015-2016.These included the Passenger Rail Agency of SA, the KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga health departments, the roads and transport, and human settlements, departments in Gauteng, and the Department of Water and Sanitation. At R1.37-billion, fruitless and wasteful expenditure in 2015-2016 was 14% higher than in 2013-2014.
