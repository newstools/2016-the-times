James Booi, who will be allowed to catch 1000t a year, is one of several influential individuals and community leaders on the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries' new list of provisional holders of fishing rights.Another is the deputy chairman of the ANC fishing unit, Faizel Moosa, whose share of the annual hake catch is to 271t. Moosa backed Booi's experiment, which was criticised as a thinly veiled attempt to enrich a well-connected individual.Now new long-term provisional allocations are under fire for similar reasons, including heavily favouring new entrants above established companies.Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana has vowed to transform what he calls the "lily-white" fishing industry. He said the new rights holders had been chosen using a fair and transparent scoring method."Any allegation that allocations have been made on any basis other than in terms of the policy and criteria set for the fisheries concerned are again devoid of merit or substance," said department spokesman Bomikazi Molapo.But Jeremy Marillier, executive director of industry umbrella body FishSA, slammed the "drastic reductions" in the commercial rights of big companies as "legally questionable".Disregard for scientific advice could also have dire consequences for exports, particularly in the lucrative hake fishery, which has to be certified by an international watchdog body that monitors sustainability, Marillier said.The department said scientific advice was only one tool in decision making."The setting of total allowable catches must ... have regard to social, economic and other management considerations," it said.Moosa - a director of Comrades Unite Performance and Outsourcing Services, which received 3% of the hake in-shore catch - said new entrants needed to be given a bigger share of fishing resources."One expected the department to have done more in terms of transformation. What they have given us is not viable on its own - I can't afford to buy a vessel," he said.
