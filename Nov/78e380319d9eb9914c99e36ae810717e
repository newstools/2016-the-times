A special executive council meeting will be held to plan its response.President Jacob Zuma visited Stjwetla in Alexandra north of Johannesburg, yesterday where toddler Everlate Chauke was swept away during last Wednesday's downpour and flash floods.Addressing residents, Zuma said the three spheres of government would work together to relocate all the displaced families into temporary shelters while the government works on a permanent solution.Zuma said 4900 people were affected by the flood and the government would dig deep to fund the Jukskei River Project to make the river safer in the rainy season."It is an emergency project that will require all of us to look for whatever money we can find," said Zuma.Gift of the Givers spokesman Ali Sayed said the NGO had spent millions helping displaced families and was happy to see that the president had acknowledged the problems faced by the greater Alexandra community.
