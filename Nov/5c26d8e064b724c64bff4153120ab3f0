Speaking to TshisaLIVE on Monday, Kelly's lawyer Ruth Makhambeni said that the star had decided to take legal action after Sam's constant public "attacks" on Kelly became "increasingly personal, deeply hurtful and harmful"."Bereavement affects us all differently. Miss Khumalo's initial stance was that Mr Sam Meyiwa was lashing out because of the grief from the death of his son. However, Mr Meyiwa's constant attacks on Ms Khumalo's character and reputation had become increasingly personal, deeply hurtful and harmful," Makhambeni said.Makhambeni added that the situation allegedly escalated to the point, where Sam was no longer grieving, but now lashing out at Kelly."Things have clearly escalated to the point where it is no longer about a father grieving his late son, but about a man desperately trying to generate maximum public sympathy by degrading Ms Khumalo in every way imaginable, " Makhambeni said.She also confirmed that should Sam not stop, they would open a case of defamation against him."Should Mr Meyiwa not stop the defamatory and demeaning conduct, Ms Khumalo intends to bring an action against him for defamation (iniuria)."But Sam has come out in defiance at the letter, calling the action "unfair and unacceptable"."So even though my son was with Kelly when he died and was shot at her home, I must stop mentioning her name? Whether I get arrested or killed, I would never stop mentioning people who were present when my son was killed. I m still coming to terms with who killed my son and what Kelly is doing to me is unfair and unacceptable. In all of this she is still playing the victim," Sam told City Press.Sam, the father of slain footballer Senzo Meyiwa, has had a long-standing feud with Kelly since the death of his son in October 2014. Senzo was shot and killed in Kelly's mother's home in Vosloorus.The pair's feud was recently thrown back into the spotlight, after Sam lambasted a tribute song Kelly recorded for Senzo.Speaking to Daily Sun recently, Sam apparently said that Kelly had written the song "simply to irritate" him and his wife, and that Kelly was happy that Senzo was dead.He had earlier told Sunday World that he hoped Kelly would "get arrested while on stage performing the song"."She can go ahead making money with the song, but it ll curse her for the rest of her life," Sam told the paper.
