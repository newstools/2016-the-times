Chiefs were always going to be up against it after Sibusiso Khumalo was sent off in the first half leaving them with a numerical disadvantage for more than an hour of fthe game .Michelle Katsvairo scored early to give Chiefs a perfect start in their bid to end a run of six matches without victory but Matthew Sim equalised early in the seconf half. But it s more like two points lost than one point gained, said City coach Etic Tinkler, whose side had numerous chances in the last 20 minutes but could not break down a resolute home defence.City had a run of seven successive wins ended but stay on in Johannesburg to take on Wits in a table toppers clash on Friday.Chiefs could have enjoyed a comfortable lead by the time that Sibusiso Khumalo was sent off in the 28th minute for a wild challenge on Thamsanqa Mkhize, catching him on the shins with an ill-timed lunge.Katsvairo knew little about the goal he scored in the fourth minute, a powerful strike from outside the area from George Maluleka striking the Zimbabwean striker on the knee and sending Shu-Aib Walters the wrong way.In the 10th minute, Edmore Chirambadare picked up a loose City pass and was all on his own on the counter with just the keeper to beat but Walters quickly cut the angle and denied Chirambadare his first league goal of the season. It was a poor effort with the goal yawning in front of him.A solo run from Siphiwe Tshabalala, on the half hour, saw him glide past six players and set up George Lebese, who inexplicably hit his shot well wide of goal when a simple tap-in would have put Chiefs two-up.Ramahalwe Mphahlele also had a chance when he reacted quickest to a throw in and was all on his ownCity also had chances but their build-up was cumbersome at times. Just before the break Sibusiso Masina s header was cleared off the line by a despairing stop by Itumeleng Khune with City protesting the ball had gone over the line.The absence of goal line technology in the Premier Soccer League was highlighted by the television replay that showed the ball had clearly cross the line and City should have had an equaliser.But it did come in the 53rd minute when substitute Sim, who had scored in August against Chiefs in the MTN8, hit from outside the area and a deflection off the foot of Lorenzo Gordinho saw the ball loop into the net.After that City had all the play but as much as they tried to get through found Chiefs not prepared to concede all three points.
