Nina con Collar (Girl with a Necklace), a 1929 oil on canvas, will be auctioned on Tuesday at Sotheby's Latin American sale. Its value is estimated at between $1.5-million and $2-million."This hung in a California home for 60 years," said Axel Stein, head of Latin American art at Sotheby's. "The painting looks very fresh. It was in a dark part of the house so the colours are vibrant."Kahlo died at age 47 in 1954. The following year her widower, the muralist Diego Rivera, gave the painting to a woman who had helped Kahlo in the studio, Stein said. She took the work home to California. Now in her mid-90s, she offered it to Sotheby's.Nina con Collar is among the first 20 of Kahlo's 143 paintings, Stein said. It prefigures hallmarks of the artist's self-portraits, including winged eyebrows and the full frontal gaze. The subject, a girl of about 13 or 14, stares directly at the viewer."There is a sense of warmth and closeness," Stein said. As in some Kahlo self-portraits, there is little depth.The background is a mix of indigo and sky-blue; the girl's face is copper-brown. She wears a jade necklace that appears in other paintings by the artist.In international art markets works by Kahlo have fetched more than any other Latin American artist, said Stein.Last May Christie's sold a 1939 Kahlo painting for $8-million, an auction record for her work.Sotheby's has privately sold individual Kahlo works for more than $15-million each, said Dan Abernethy, an auction house spokesman.One reason Kahlo works are so valued in the international market is that Mexico for several decades has barred their export to conserve the country's cultural heritage under national patrimony laws, Stein said.
