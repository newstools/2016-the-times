Two days before the election, the self-styled prophet of the Synagogue of the Church Of All Nations took to Facebook to share his predictions."Ten days ago I saw the new President of America with a narrow win. The new President will be facing several challenges over many issues including: passing bills attempts to possibly pass a vote of no confidence on the new President.The boat of the new president will be rocked. By the way, in order not to keep you in suspense what I frankly saw is a woman," he said. Given that a woman is surely not America's new president, Twitter users are slamming Joshua for his 'false' prophecy.Spoiler: The tweets are hilarious!
