Defence advocate Terry Price SC played a recording to the court in which Warrant Officer Leon Eksteen could be heard telling the Panayiotou family after Christopher s arrest on April 29 last year that he was stupid for thinking he could trust these black men.He was referring to alleged middleman Luthando Siyoni and suspected triggerman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke.While Eksteen said he could not recall using this word he conceded that this was not a nice way to refer to any person.Judge Dayalin Chetty is yet to rule on the admissibility of the secret recording.The trial-within-a-trial continues on Thursday.-TMG Diugital/The Herald
