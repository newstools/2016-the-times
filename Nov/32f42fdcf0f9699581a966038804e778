This is according to political analyst Somadoda Fikeni and legal expert Shadrack Gutto, who said the deadly blow to Zuma's application was Mkhwebane's confirmation that the report had been finalised by Madonsela.Zuma had hoped that the report would be regarded as "interim" and that he would get access to those who had implicated him in the report and thus influence the final version."The president was really trying to manipulate the system by pinning his hopes on the new public protector being kinder to him than Thuli Madonsela, but he realised that the end was near when the new public protector confirmed that the report was final."I can't see how two public protectors can have different views on the same report," said Gutto.Said Fikeni: "The new public protector had already said that the report was final, meaning that it could not be re-engineered and could be reviewed only by a court of law. He might have realised that for the report to be reviewed it would first have to be released."Zuma might also have decided to withdraw his application after the Pretoria High Court struck minister Des van Rooyen's urgent application for an interdict on the report from the roll, said Fikeni."He can't review a report that merely says there are signs of wrongdoing, because if he does he runs the risk of being accused of seeking to prevent an investigation that could bring to light actions that are said to result in state capture."
