Substitute Genevieve Ngo Mbeleck struck in the 81st minute to hand the hosts the winning goal in the Group A match.Cameroon have two wins from two, enough to top the group and reach the semis. Banyana need a victory against Egypt to stand a chance of progressing.South Africa coach Desiree Ellis had made two changes from South Africa s opening 0-0 group stage draw against Zimbabwe, with Andiwe Mgcoyi and Jermaine Seopesenwe coming in for Refiloe Jane and Shiwe Nogwanya.That result and last night s defeat meant Banyana will have to win their final game against Egypt in Yaounde to reach the semis, depending on the result of Cameroon against Zimbabwe.Tuesday night s late match pitted Egypt, 2-0 losers against Cameroon in their first game, against Zimbabwe.Banyana s match-up against the hosts was a classic duel of Southern African quickness and skill against West African physicality.Cameroon dominated the first half-hour in front of their packed home stadium. Slowly, though, the South Africa gained their confidence and found their feet, finishing the first half the stronger side.With Cameroon pushing hard for an opening goal, their best chance of the opening half came in the 27th minute. Winger Aboudi Onguene showed good skill on the left and put in a cross that found centre-forward Madeleine Ngono, who headed wide.South Africa s best chance of the half came when Mgcoyi went up and beat goalkeeper Annette Ndom to a high cross, her header looping into the top netting.Cameroon had the better of the territory and possession at the start of the second half. Again, though, they could only really create half chances, such as when forward Mouffemetou Falone struck into the chest of South Africa captain Janine van Wyk.The home team increasingly piled on the pressure.With 10 minutes left, from Ngono s corner big forward Enganamouit Gaelle s header went a foot over Banyana goalkeeper Andile Dlamini s goal.Then Gaelle went up for a header with Dlamini, who went down from the challenge injured, as Ngo Mbeleck swept in the winning goal from the loose ball.Banyana s Nompulelelo Myandeni headed wide from a corner with three minutes remaining, spurning a golden chance to equalise.
