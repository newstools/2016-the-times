United beat Pirates 6-1 in a breathtaking second half display of attacking football that stunned the visitors and effortlessly carved their rearguard like a hot knife through butter.Incredibly, it was Pirates who got on the Mbombela Stadium scoreboard first and many fans would have assumed that the Bucs would cruise to victory after Tendai Ndoro scored the opening goal just before the half time break.But after scoring the opening goal of the match, Pirates never returned from their locker room and it was the enterprising United side that took control of the match in the second half.United signalled their intentions shortly after the restart when evergreen veteran Reneilwe Letsholonyane fired a scorching shot that butterfingered Pirates goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo parried into his own net in the 52nd minute.It was a shocking display from Mhlongo and he will be kicking himself after conceding the equaliser in such fashion in his near post.It was a man-of-the-match performance from Letsholonyane and he controlled the midfield with the finesse of a painter, pretty much rubbished ascertions that he left his best days at former club Kaizer Chiefs.New Zealander Michael Boxall gave United the lead only two minutes later when he scored from close range.The now dazed visitors had barely recovered when Boxall scored his second and United s third of the night only momemets later.Thuso Phala was not going to be denied when a seemingly generous Pirates was handing out party favours and he scored United s fourth in the 64th minute.Bradley Grobler headed the fifth goal of the night past the bemused Mhlongo in the 74th minute.The humiliation was complete when Brockie scored the sixth from the penalty spot just before fulltime.And as if to confirm that this was not Pirates night, Ndoro missed a penalty right at the death and Pirates will return back to Johannesburg with their tails firmly between their legs.The final score was flattering to Pirates and they could have conceded more goals.Pirates coach Muhsin Ertugral often looked like he was close to tears during the match and he will wake up on Wednesday morning hoping it was all a very bad dream until he sees the headlines screaming back at him.
