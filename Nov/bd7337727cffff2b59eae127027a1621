Unlike in previous years, they will not have to bring their own water because severe water restrictions have been lifted.Cobus Oelofse, CEO of iLembe Chamber of Commerce, said due to an increase in the level of Hazemere Dam, restrictions were lifted three months ago after being in force for two years.He said the restrictions and vigorous water policing meant that tourists to KwaZulu-Natal would benefit this festive season."It was through the willingness of the district water authorities, the community and businesses that we minimised the impact."Communities responded through communications via Whatsapp groups, sharing best practice and almost becoming competitive in terms of how much water they saved. The response to the water crisis was magnificent."Oelofse praised Sembcorp Siza Water, which supplies water to the region, for being able to identify where the pressure points were and addressing those."Pamphlets and stickers were made available to the tourist and hospitality industry, informing them of the water crisis and asking them to please use water sparingly," Oelofse said.Water policing was rigorous and KwaDukuza fire and emergency service was fined R3000 after employees were spotted washing a fire truck.Fines were also handed out to residents who failed to reduce their water use by 30%.New swimming pools could not be built and water features had to be disconnected.Existing pools could only be topped up with recycled water and hosepipes were banned, golf courses were not allowed to use potable water for irrigation and residents could only wash their cars using a bucket.Sembcorp Siza Water managing director Shyam Misra said the rise in Hazelmere Dam levels, plus augmented supplies from their recycling water plant, meant there would be no interruptions to the festive season water supply."Holidaymakers in our area will not need to pack bottled water," said Misra.
