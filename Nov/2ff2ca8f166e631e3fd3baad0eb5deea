Goddard was the epitome of the allrounder capable of opening the batting as well as the bowling.He did both left-handed and expertly enough to score 26 centuries and take 24 five-wicket hauls in his 179 first-class matches.Forty-one of them were tests played between June 1955 in Nottingham and February 1970 in Johannesburg and 13 of those were as South Africa s captain.Goddard first led South Africa on their tour to Australia in the second half of the summer of 1963-64 when the visitors were written off as no-hopers before they left home but drew the test series.Donald Bradman described Goddard as a completely reliable and honest player who could be depended upon before any season started to put up a sterling performance over a whole series .Bradman said Goddard had qualities of sincerity and integrity and enriched the game of cricket and set a fine example .After retiring from cricket Goddard became an evangelist preacher.- TMG Digital
