The SA Banking Risk Information Centre has warned against holiday-home scams, and criminals using your phone and social media profiles to commit credit-card fraud.Private investigator Mike Bolhuis, investigating holiday accommodation fraud, has told The Times that small syndicates fleece prospective holidaymakers out of money by pretending to be property owners.Sabric CEO Kalyani Pillay said a common fraud at this time of the year involved advertising holiday accommodation at very attractive prices to lure victims into booking."Once they receive the money from the victim they will not be contactable and the victims lose their money. The accommodation or booking is nonexistent," Pillay said.Heslie Klugman, 86, knows this trick all too well. He fell victim to it last year after responding to an advert offering accommodation at Sun City."It seemed very reasonable. I asked the person listed as the contact for specifics. We arranged a price of R12000. He was very convincing," Klugman said."I asked him about guest certificates and other information, but he became very elusive. He stopped taking my calls. Apparently this guy conned about 30 people for the same holiday accommodation," he said."It was goodbye to the R12,000. There was nothing I could do."Klugman asked Bolhuis to assist with the case, with the police also investigating."These guys hijack information and photos and then forge their own advertisements. They use prepaid and cloned phones, and phones that haven't been RICAed (registered), and set up fake e-mail addresses to communicate with you," Bolhuis said."They're clever, knowledgeable, patient criminals. Not your average guy on the street," he said.Bolhuis explained that these fraudsters operated in groups of two to five. They usually defraud a few people before the police uncover their operations."If they get a feeling someone is onto them, they usually delete all traces of their operation and start again," he said.He advised holidaymakers to contact the people who accepted the advert for placement, to ask the seller for references, and to do some research before parting with any money to avoid landing in a situation like Klugman's.Sabric also warned about what you put online or say over the phone.In the first nine months of this year alone, more than R500-million was stolen in debit-and-credit-card fraud on South African cards - up 0.4% on the corresponding period the previous year.Fraudsters used voice soliciting, or "vishing", to manipulate people into disclosing confidential information by phoning them and posing as a bank official or service provider.The police intend increasing the number of men they have on the beat over the festive season. Such a move last year achieved encouraging results.A daily average of 20940 police officers were dispatched to shopping centres across Gauteng, Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape, resulting in a reduction of crime during the 2015 festive season compared to the previous year, said the police.Many of the officers were trainees and recent police college graduates.The police said they deployed a daily average of 5399 members in Gauteng, 4146 in KwaZulu-Natal and 2935 in Western Cape during the festive season last year.Acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane said last year's boots-on-the-ground tactic had "the desired effect" and boosted public confidence in the police."All available resources, including the trainees, will be mobilised and deployed in strategic areas ... We do that knowing that everyone goes into shopping mode, goes into holiday mode, and just like you're looking for a bonus, criminals are looking for a place where they can get more," he said.Phahlane said the Christmas visible-policing drive helped train rookie police officers, many of whom made arrests.According to a report on the 2015 visibility campaign, KwaZulu-Natal was the only province in which there was an increase in crime in December.Institute for Security Studies senior police researcher Johan Burger said the deployment of extra police officers during the festive season was a "good strategy" for deterring criminals.However, Burger said, improvements in crime intelligence would go a long way towards thwarting criminals."The police need to sort out crime intelligence to target the organised crime syndicates that are responsible for the truck hijackings, cellphone- and electronics-shop robberies, and so on," he said."They need to identify the syndicates, and infiltrate and neutralise them."The only way to do this is through a working crime intelligence unit."University of South Africa criminologist Rudolph Zinn said his research, which involved interviewing convicted criminals, indicated that about 60% of them were deterred from committing a crime when they saw an increase in the number of officers on patrol."There is definitely a lot of value in it but it should not be a predictable strategy."If it is to be successful, the criminals shouldn't be able to work out the routine, otherwise they will just wait for the right time to strike."
