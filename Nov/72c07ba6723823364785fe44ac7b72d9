But Du Plessis seems likely to have the last laugh at least on this tour: it appears the charges will be heard only after the third Test which starts on Thursday.That would make Du Plessis safe from the prospect of being banned for the match which could be his punishment if he is found guilty.The charges were laid after television footage emerged after the second Test in Hobart showing Du Plessis polishing the ball using saliva fetched from his mouth - in which what appears to be a sweet or mint is clearly visible.Security staff intervened when Du Plessis was accosted by reporters outside the squad hotel in Melbourne at the weekend - against the express wishes of team management.More drama unfolded when the squad arrived in Adelaide. Team officials told the waiting reporters that no questions could be asked of the South African players as they moved through the airport but the request was ignored.After Du Plessis in sunglasses and headphones had - according to team management - ignored three questions when a reporter thrust a microphone in the South African captain s face.Think this Proteas trainer has been watching too much NFL.

The reporter then shoved Moosajee in the back.After the incident Hashim Amla who voiced a passionate defence of Du Plessis in Melbourne on Friday posted on social media: Disappointed.. such provocative behaviour from reporters.Let a man walk in peace.Ask with manners n courtesy and u prob will get a response.All of which could prompt the International Cricket Council to delay the hearing until after the third Test and once the South Africans have left Australia.In any event the fact that a lawyer has been summoned from South Africa - and the resultant complications with obtaining a visa at short notice - could push the hearing beyond Thursday. - TMG Sport
