The Morgan Tsvangirai-led Movement for Democratic Change (MDC-T) and former vice-president Joice Mujuru's Zim-PF are not at the discussions, raising serious concerns about the coalition's chances of success.Reports in Zimbabwe say Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe personally engaged the two leaders on the matter.However, they backtracked at the last minute.People's Democratic Party leader Tendai Biti said the coalition might fail because of "egocentric and selfish" politicians."We have to go beyond these individuals and establish a matrix of working together," Biti said.Tsvangirai and Mujuru have each declared they could lead the coalition, a situation that has caused anger among opposition politicians.The MDC-T said it would not join a coalition set up outside Zimbabwe.
