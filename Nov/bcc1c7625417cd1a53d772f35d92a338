The research involved a sample of 763 cricket umpires, of whom the majority were qualified volunteers over 55.Shockingly, well over half (56.2%) said they had experienced verbal abuse, while 21 respondents had even experienced physical abuse.Marylebone Cricket Club, the global custodians of cricket's laws since 1787, is now moving towards formally changing one of the fundamental traditions by introducing on-field and in-game sanctions for bad behaviour.The proposed sanctions would be on a sliding scale and include run deductions, sin-bins for a certain number of overs or simply sendings-off.Neil Priscott, the head of media and communications at the MCC, said it was an issue being "taken very seriously" and acknowledged the sense of a worsening problem.A change to the next updated Laws of the Game in October next year would not be feasible, but more extensive trials, including in matches abroad, will take place."The trials suggested that an on-field deterrent or punishment were something we must pursue," said Priscott."It was also something that captains and umpires want to see. It did appear to have a positive impact. We are now aiming to expand it."
