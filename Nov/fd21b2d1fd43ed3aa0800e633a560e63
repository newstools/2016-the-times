After getting off to a late start in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Wednesday morning Luthando Siyoni 36 finally took to the stand telling state advocate Marius Stander that he would not answer to any lies .Siyoni who worked for murder accused Christopher Panayiotou 30 as a bouncer at his Algoa Park night club previously made a statement in terms of Section 204 of the Criminal Procedure Act in which he detailed his alleged involvement in Jayde Panayiotou s murder.The job of a Section 204 witness in exchange for immunity from prosecution is to incriminate himself in the offence.Siyoni told police at the time that Panayiotou approached him towards the end of 2014 to ask him to arrange a hitman to kill his wife Jayde 29.His statement taken down by investigating officer Captain Kanna Swanepoel shortly after his arrest on April 27 last year was signed by his Legal Aid SA appointed representative advocate Johan van der Spuy.On Wednesday morning however after alleging that Van der Spuy was not actually present when the statement was taken and merely signed it afterwards to appease the court Siyoni said he would not answer any questions put to him by the state.Jayde was murdered after she was kidnapped from outside her Kabega Park home while waiting for a lift to work on April 21 last year.Panayiotou Sizwezakhe Vumazonke 36 Sinethemba Nemembe 28 and Zolani Sibeko 35 all pleaded not guilty to the kidnapping robbery and murder. Vumazonke has since died.Siyoni was due to return to the stand on Wednesday afternoon.- TMG Digital/HeraldLIVE
