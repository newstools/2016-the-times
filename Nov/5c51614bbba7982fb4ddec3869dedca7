But critics have slammed the move as nothing more than "reverse engineering" and have threatened a judicial challenge against the Department of Energy.The announcement of the delay followed last month's resignation of Eskom head Brian Molefe, who had been championing the expansion of nuclear energy while downplaying the potential of renewable energy and refusing to enter into new power purchasing deals with independent power producers.The government's integrated resource plan, to be refined in March, will put more emphasis on renewable energy, as well as on coal and gas.The plan envisages:There is little analysis of costs in the integrated resource plan. The Department of Energy attributes this to changing circumstances and the need to keep an open mind on the exact energy mix, while public comment is being heard.The decision to push out the start of the new nuclear energy project might ease some of the worries of the ratings agencies about government spending at a time when the Treasury is trying to control spending to bring down the fiscal deficit."The ratings agencies' biggest concern with the nuclear plan would be the cost and the amount of debt that the government has to carry for it," said Christie Viljoen, an economist at KPMG.Shaun Nel, spokesman for the Energy-intensive Users' Group, said: "It seems some realism has come to the fore ... which is why [the government plan] relies heavily on renewables and gas in the short term."Eskom has said it will press ahead with its request for proposals this year from companies that build nuclear power plants.Over the past two years President Jacob Zuma and Russian President Vladimir Putin have met on numerous occasions, fuelling speculation that Russian state-run nuclear group Rosatom had secured a deal before the issuing of an invitation to tender.The South African government and Rosatom have denied this.The announcement of the delay in the nuclear programme might have allayed investors' fears, which have mounted as the country's economic growth shows little sign of improving and the ratings agencies threaten to downgrade its economy to junk status.Moody's and S&amp;P Global Ratings are due to revise their assessments of the quality of South Africa's sovereign debt within two weeks.The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse yesterday expressed outrage over the new plans.Outa's portfolio director for energy, Ted Blom, said they had been six years in the making and were four years late."It comes at a time when profound questions are being asked about state capture and corruption in Eskom."In our opinion, the entire process reeks of reverse engineering to try to accommodate the introduction of nuclear energy."He said decisions had been taken to keep a window open to justify a false need for nuclear power."The rational approach would dictate that every updating of the integrated resource plan was to run a lowest-cost model, as advised by the ministerial advisory commission on energy."Had this been done, the base case model for the plan would have shown that nuclear was not needed and the entire nuclear debate would have been over."Blom said that, instead, ministerial determinations made until December 2015 were assumed to have been cast in stone and it was never asked whether we should be building nuclear but rather when.He said the draft plan for 2016 indicated that nuclear was not required before 2037."This indicates that the nuclear debate should not be entertained for another eight years or so."Blom said Outa had pointed out several other inconsistencies that pointed to a reverse-engineered outcome.He said these included that the government relied on a plan from 2010, which showed that nuclear energy was needed whereas a plan from 2013 showed the opposite."False scenarios were provided to justify the nuclear decision and in essence, a series of policy adjustments appears to have been made before the public consultation process started.""Outa is [considering] a judicial challenge to halt the department's flawed process which could have extremely expensive and adverse decisions for South Africa," he said. - Additional reporting by Reuters and Bloomberg
