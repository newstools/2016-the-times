"The prosecution of people who are demanding the land affects us directly because we want the land, so the land must be returned to the hands of the people," said Malema.He was addressing hundreds of EFF supporters outside the Newcastle Magistrate's Court after appearing briefly for contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956.The case was postponed to December 7 to allow for the filing of an application to the Constitutional Court that it find the apartheid-era law unconstitutional."When the state has failed to give you the land for the past 22 years, it will be irresponsible for me to say 'continue waiting'."That's why I say occupy the land because they have failed to give you the land."If it means going to prison for telling you to take the land, then so be it," the firebrand EFF leader said."The country is still in the hands of the colonial masters. This country is still in the hands of white people."This country is controlled from London [as] there are still pieces of land here in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and other rural provinces whose title deeds are still owned by the Queen in London," said Malema.During his appearance in court, his lawyer, Tumi Mokwena, asked for the matter to be postponed to May 5 to allow Malema to file his court application.The state agreed to the postponement of the magistrate's court trial to May 5 on condition that Malema provide proof that he had petitioned the Constitutional Court.Constitutional law expert Pierre de Vos said Malema could have a case."The law itself is very broad and I don't know which part of it Malema's lawyer is arguing about."This is one of those repressive laws enacted [to] crush freedom fighters."- Additional reporting by Nathi Olifant
