ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe speaking after a meeting of the party's national working committee (NWC) said the commission "must be established like any other judicial commission of inquiry".The stance of the ANC NWC echoed that of Zuma backers in the North West who on Monday said it was the sole prerogative of the president to appoint a commission of inquiry.Public Protector Thuli Madonsela in the remedial action of her report titled State of Capture said the president should appoint a judicial commission on inquiry in 30 days to be presided over by a judge selected by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.She also said that this judge should have powers no less than that of the public protector's office itself.Mantashe said the NWC felt it was not Madonsela's place to determine how the commission should be constituted as this was spelled out in the Constitution.When asked whether Zuma could still appoint a judge despite being implicated in the report he said this would have to be clarified by the courts when the report was taken up on review. Mining minister Mosebenzi Zwane and Acting Eskom CE Brian Molefe have said they would seek to have the report set aside by the courts.The report said Zuma may have violated the Executive Ethics Code and the Constitution.Mantashe said the NWC had "noted" that the outcome of Madonsela's report was the same as one of the demands made by the Economic Freedom Fighters during coalition talks with the ANC after the 2016 election."That coincidence is one that we are noting " he said.The NWC said calls for Zuma to step down in the aftermath of the release of the report was "premature and unfounded".Mantashe also said opposition parties calling for a motion of no confidence in Zuma was a reflection of "their growing arrogance rather than reality".The ANC also called on its members not to "play to the gallery" on this issue.- TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
