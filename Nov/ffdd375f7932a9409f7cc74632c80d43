This is big news because it gives Ramaphosa a national constituency and the backing of the most organised albeit fading formation inside the ANC tent. Cosatu offers him the capacity to lobby and influence the ANC at branch level, a crucial stepping stone to winning at an ANC conference. It also suggests that the Marikana ghost, which has haunted Ramaphosa since he was accused of backing the police action against strikers, has finally been laid to rest.The endorsement of Ramaphosa has been a long time coming.Most Cosatu unions have been lobbying for a while for the federation to take a position and announce it publicly.The move is a blow to Zuma and his allies, who are pushing for AU commission chairman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to take over.Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali, speaking after Cosatu s central executive committee meeting, said that federation bosses had reflected on the political gridlock in the ANC. He added: ... after intense and robust debate the CEC resolved to support and lobby for the deputy president of the ANC, Comrade Cyril Ramaphosa, to take over the reins as the president of the ANC. Cosatu will lobby other ANC structures to support Ramaphosa.It also came out in support of a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture that would look into the allegedly corrupt relationship between Zuma, cabinet ministers and the Gupta family.The ball is now firmly in Dlamini-Zuma s court and you can expect the Zuma-aligned organisations of the ANC its women s and youth leagues, for example to come out in support of her in the coming weeks.
