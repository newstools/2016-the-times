An undated letter thought to have been written by Lennon in 1971 is being sold for $20,000 by RR Auction.Addressed to "Linda and Paul", the typed letter - on a letterhead illustrated with the faces of Lennon and Yoko Ono - doesn't hold back in addressing the recent break-up of The Beatles, Lennon's relationship with the press and with Ono. It's thought to be a response to a letter Linda McCartney had sent Lennon, chiding him for not openly announcing his departure from the band.The Beatles publicly broke up in 1970, although Lennon had left the band in September 1969 following a combination of the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, legal tussles over their record label and business Apple Corps, and McCartney and Lennon meeting Linda and Ono, respectively.Lennon explains that he didn't make his departure public because "Paul and Klein [Allen Klein, The Beatles' new manager] both spent the day persuading me it was better not to say anything - asking me not to say anything because it would 'hurt the Beatles' - and 'let's just let it petre [sic] out' - remember? So get that into your petty little perversion of a mind, Mrs McCartney - the c*** asked me to keep quiet about it."With regard to his and Ono's relationship, Lennon writes, among other things: "I hope you realise what s**t you and the rest of my 'kind and unselfish' friends laid on Yoko and me, since we've been together. It might have sometimes been a bit more subtle or should I say 'middle class' - but not often. We both 'rose above it' quite a few times &amp; forgave you two, so it's the least you can do for us, you noble people."The Imagine songwriter also takes the opportunity to insult Linda's family, and said the McCartneys' marriage would be over in two years.Finally, he signs off: "Inspite [sic] of it all, love to you both, from us two."The letter was last up for sale in 2011, asking price $40 000.
