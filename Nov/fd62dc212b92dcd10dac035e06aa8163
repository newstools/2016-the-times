Vernon Philander and debutant left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj claimed seven wickets between them to dismiss the home side for 244 in reply to South Africa s first innings of 242.Limiting Australia s lead to only two runs seemed out of reach for South Africa when the Aussies resumed on 105 without loss.But South Africa claimed all 10 wickets for 86 runs and began their second innings after tea.Steyn clutched his shoulder immediately after bowling the fourth delivery of his 13th over of the innings and his seventh of the day.He sank to his haunches and left the field after consulting with team physiotherapist Brandon Jackson.Minutes later Steyn was seen in the dressingroom with his shoulder - the same one he broke in December during the series against England - heavily strapped.Team management said Steyn had aggravated an old right shoulder injury and had gone to the hospital for further investigations .During the tea interval he was seen congratulating his teammates by slapping them on the back - but only with his left hand. He held his right arm at an awkward angle.Australia resumed with David Warner on 73 not out and seemingly locked and loaded for a century.But midway through a first session in which South Africa s bowlers rediscovered the discipline they had misplaced on Thursday Warner angled his bat to guide Steyn through point and instead steered a catch to Hashim Amla at slip.Warner s 97 was studded with 16 fours and a six and came off 100 balls.His dismissal ended a stand of 158 he shared with Shaun Marsh.That turned out to be the only stand of the innings to reach 30.With what became the last ball before lunch Philander trapped Marsh in front for 63 with a delivery that seamed into the left-hander.No other Australian batsman made it out of the 20s.Maharaj bowled with nagging accuracy from the northern or Prindiville Stand end for the entire second session for his return of 3/56.Philander found movement off the seam and claimed 4/56. - TMG Sport
