Anger and disappointment among those who voted for Clinton - 61.5% of Californian voters, against 32.3% for Trump - has seen a marked increase in attention for the Yes California campaign, with supporters making "Calexit" a trending topic on social media.The Yes California website states: "We advocate for peaceful secession from the US by use of an independence referendum to establish a mandate, followed by a nationwide campaign to advocate in support of a constitutional exit from the union."The campaign has some high-profile backers, including Silicon Valley luminaries such as Shervin Pishevar, co-founder of Hyperloop, who announced on Twitter that he planned to fund a "legitimate campaign for California to become its own nation".He described his backing for Calexit as "the most patriotic thing I can do. We can re-enter the union after California becomes a nation. As the sixth-largest economy in the world, the economic engine of the nation and provider of a large percentage of the federal budget, California carries a lot of weight."The Yes California website says the state would be legally entitled to secede from the union if an amendment to the US constitution was proposed and approved by two-thirds of the House of Representatives and Senate. The amendment would then have to be accepted by at least 38 of the 50 states to be adopted.Campaigners are proposing a referendum on the issue in 2019.
