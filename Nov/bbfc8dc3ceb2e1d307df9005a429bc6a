The former ANC MP was one of the first people to speak out about the influence of the Gupta family on the state, alleging that they offered her the public enterprises ministry at their home in Saxonwold.She reported this to the Hawks in March but they claimed they had failed to "locate" her."Only when they saw in the media that I had gone to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate to report them, then they go around saying that they can't find me," Mentor said."They sent me an SMS and I have responded to them ... this is how I am. You are calling me and I am answering your call."Mentor said the Hawks were incompetent."They are headed by foolish people who cannot find a poor woman. I am not even a criminal."
