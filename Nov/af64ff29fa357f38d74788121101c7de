His next bid for bail is on Monday.At a media briefing on Friday Gazuzu Nduli a FeesMustFall activist called on people stand up and support Khanyile."The management of educational institutions across the country have actively participated in criminalising students as we have seen with the countless interdicts arrests and subsequent criminal charges suspensions and expulsions that have been meted out against student. Twenty-two years into democracy yet we still see the state using the same old tactics of apartheid by the unlawful and unjust arrest " said Nduli.He said Khanyile has been denied bail just for participating in a protest yet criminals accused of worse crimes such as murder and rape are granted bail."We call for the immediate release of our fellow student. He must be allowed to spend quality time with his family and loved ones as we approach the festive holidays. We call on all students and broader society to stand in solidarity with us " he said.Anglican priest Vernon Hammond who is in support of the FeesMustFall said that to have a student still in prison was not only unjust but unfair and unethical."I together with other members of the clergy will be in court to say we are tired of brutality " said Hammond.
