One source, speaking to CNN, described the fierce lobbying as "a knife fight".Trump and Pence will "be reviewing a number of names" for cabinet positions, Jason Miller, a transition communications adviser, told reporters at Trump Tower.Trump appeared to be torn between a campaign promise to shake up Washington and the need to build a cabinet with political experience and connections with Congress.Candidates for secretary of state included hawkish former diplomat John Bolton and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, US media reported.Retired General Michael Flynn is a likely national security adviser and Republican Senator Jeff Sessions could become secretary of defence or attorney-general, according to CNN.CBS and CNN also reported that the transition team was seeking top security clearances for Trump's adult children.Trump, however, did not ask for this step be taken, and the Trump children have not started on the paperwork for such clearances, a transition official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Trump on Sunday tapped Steve Bannon, chairman of conservative news platform Breitbart, as his chief strategist, and Reince Priebus, head of the Republican National Committee, as his chief of staff.Miller gave few details about the people under consideration."You can't believe everything you read. I don't want to play the speculation game as far as names go," Miller said."There will be non-traditional names, a number of people who have had wide-ranging success in a number of fields."
