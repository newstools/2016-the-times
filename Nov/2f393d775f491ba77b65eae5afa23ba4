This is according to ANC Youth League (ANCYL) president Collen Maine who was speaking at the party's KwaZulu-Natal cadres forum in KwaDukuza at the Stanger City Hall on Saturday."President the Youth League and members of the ANC want you to lead the ANC until your term ends in 2017. The Youth League and its volunteers and members of the ANC want to see you being the president of the country until 2019 " Maine reiterated."Our message is very simple a president will not be removed through a report of State of Capture report - a president can only be removed through the ballot. President Zuma has not left with Thuli Madonsela (former Public Protector) on [14] October he's still here with us " added Maine.This comes as Zuma is on a roadshow visiting the party's strongholds and responding to detractors in what has been described as an "unofficial campaign trail".On Friday Zuma was in Pietermaritzburg speaking to members that filled the city hall to capacity where he also spoke of his resilience in the wake of increasing attacks on his leadership by ANC stalwarts and senior members.This comes as several organisations and individuals who have previously expressed their dissatisfaction with Zuma have joined forces in their call for him to step down.
