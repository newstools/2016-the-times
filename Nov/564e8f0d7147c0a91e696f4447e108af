Wikus Ceronie was crossing the Mozambique border from the park when a hippo took charged his car."There were people walking around in the nearby vicinity so I automatically assumed this hippo was used to humans. I was quite fascinated by this so I took out my phone to start filming," Ceronie told Latest Sightings.The hippo charged the bakkie and tried to take a bite out of it, only to then turn around and leave.The 26-year-old welding inspector said the experience was terrifying, but he was lucky the hippo took the bakkie head on - if the hippo decided to slam into the car's side Ceronie is sure it would have rolled down the embankment.While the hippo caused extensive damage to Wikus' bonnet, and its door won't open anymore, neither Ceronie nor the hippo suffered any serious injuries.Hippos are considered one of the most dangerous species in Africa, largely because of their unpredictable behaviour.
