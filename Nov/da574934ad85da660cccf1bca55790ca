Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, said the number of ex-players coming forward was likely to grow significantly and that other sports governing bodies would be dragged into ongoing inquiries.Bailey delivered his grim forecast after the National Association for People Abused in Childhood revealed it was aware of anecdotal evidence of child abuse in swimming, tennis and judo. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, "I am not in the least bit surprised that we are now seeing the lid lifted on exploitation within football and I suspect there will be other sporting governing bodies - again in the next few days and weeks - who will come forward and who will identify the fact that they have similar problems."The FA is struggling to come to terms with the scale of the alleged abuse within the national game. FA chairman Greg Clarke said last week the governing body would "take any action necessary" to end it.
