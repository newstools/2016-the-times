This was one of the submissions made by advocate William Mokhari SC for Sars and its commissioner Tom Moyane in the defamation case against former spokesperson Adrian Lackay.In the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria Lackay on Tuesday effectively asked the court to throw the case against him out arguing that Sars and Moyane had not pleaded their case against him sufficiently.One of the arguments raised by Lackay's lawyer Max du Plessis in respect of this is the fact that Sars as an organ of state cannot sue for defamation.Mokhari hit back at this however saying Sars has special functions which sets it apart from other state organs and should be allowed to sue."It performs a critical function. It operates outside the public service."When Sars' reputation is damaged the entire economy collapses " he said.Moyane and Sars are suing Lackay for allegedly defamatory statements he made in a letter to Parliament last year titled "Sars: This is the inside story".In the letter Lackay suggested that Moyane had misled Parliament and the nation relating to the alleged establishment of a "rouge investigation unit" at Sars.The combined claim for damages sits at R12 million.Du Plessis had argued that the damages claim was vague and embarrassing as it appeared to be a thumb-sucked figure. He asked Sars and Moyane to justify the high cost.He said Lackay would be out of pocket if such a sum had to be paid.Mokhari responded saying "Who cares where he is going to get the money?"He said that quantifying reputational damage was difficult and that it was not the correct point in the legal process to consider this.Du Plessis disagreed. He argued that more details on the monetary claim would enable Lackay to make a decision as to whether he would like to settle case and not be subjected to further litigation.Du Plessis also said that it was not clear whether Sars and Moyane allege that Lackay had distributed the letter to the media. He said that Lackay had not intended the letter for public consumption but for a limited audience in Parliament.Mokhari said that the media was included in the claim.He further argued that it was Lackay's defense that was lacking: "They are asking the court to say that calling someone a liar is not defamation."Instead Lackay should argue that he was telling the truth which is in the public's interest Mokhari said.The court has reserved its judgment and will notify parties when it has decided whether to grant the exception applied for by Lackay. If granted the case will effectively be thrown out of court. If refused the defamation case will be heard.Lackay declined to comment until judgment has been given.- TMG Digital
