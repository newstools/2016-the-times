The Team of Choice are now seeking a Mother City "double" as they prepare to face the high-flying Cape Town City at Athlone Stadium tonight.United secured their 2-1 win with the final kick of the game as left-back Deolin Mekoa, who had been given a torrid night by Mark Mayambela, earned just a second-ever victory against any of the Premier Soccer League's Cape Town clubs in their past 19 visits to the city.The victory moved United into the top half of the table and they could jump as high as sixth with another win against Eric Tinkler's in-form side.It was achieved with a stoic coach Ernst Middendorp sitting in the stands as his assistant Fadlu Davids prowled the touchline. The victory over the Urban Warriors was just a second this season for United.
