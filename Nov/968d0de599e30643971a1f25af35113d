The plush new building is the latest addition to the Foreshore, where more than R6-billion has been invested since 2012, and will form part of a world-class medical precinct.The earthquake-proof building, which will be unveiled on December 3, is built on reclaimed land and is secured by four massive pins anchored in the city s bedrock.The interior is of a race-track design that allows for more efficient care of patients, all 248 of whom will have a bed near to the glass panels that clad the building, giving them superb ocean, city and mountain views. This is probably the finest hospital we have constructed in South Africa or the UK, said Netcare CEO Richard Friedland. We spent two years thinking about whether we should renovate the old [Christiaan Barnard] hospital up the road, or build a new one. When we saw that the cost of renovating was not much less than a new building, we decided to build. The hospital is named in tribute to the world-renowned surgeon who performed the first heart transplant.The facility also included a first of its own, with windows being fitted to theatre rooms so that doctors and medical staff would know what time of day it was while performing long surgeries. The hospital s maternity ward was also fitted with breast milk bar and a halaal kitchen.Hospital manager Chris Tilney said the building was designed in accordance with international standards but had unique aesthetic aspects. We have unique sculptures and other art throughout the hospital. Netcare has leased the adjacent Chevron building, which will be renovated and will form part of the precinct, which will eventually offer primary, secondary and tertiary medical, emergency, diagnostic and rehabilitative services.
