Property experts say a growing number of South Africans are looking for smaller, environmentally friendly homes.Property data company Lightstone has recently seen a 7% growth in the sale of houses in the R700,000 range.Lightstone believes this could be an indicator of a "movement from luxury to mid-value homes".Modern homes are becoming smaller as more people look to live in sectional title apartments, or homes that require less maintenance, say the property gurus.Laurie Wener, Pam Golding Properties' senior executive, said the look and feel of homes had changed."While it depends on the area we are seeing a trend towards flexible, open-plan designs with all bedrooms en-suite, and usually smaller in size for easier maintenance."We are also seeing the use of strong, lightweight structures for some types of construction, as well as insulated or prefabricated walls that reduce weight and labour costs, coupled with an alternative power supply," said Wener.According to a National Association of Home Builders US 2015 survey, millennials - people who reached adulthood in the year 2000 - are driving down home sizes."Millennials don't have as much ready cash or free time as older homeowners, so they are seeking less expensive, more low-maintenance choices for their homes," the survey found.Property expert Carol Reynolds said homes were becoming less ostentatious and more ecologically friendly with the use of raw, natural materials for building."The look of the modern home is one of simple, understated elegance that complements the environment."We see a shift from the notion of a large mansion standing proud on its erf to a smaller stylish home that is secondary to the natural beauty that envelops it."Today it is more about the natural landscape and its inherent beauty than the home that happens to rest on."This trend is particularly evident in beautiful areas like the KwaZulu-Natal coastal belt, where living outdoors is part of the lifestyle offering."We note a shift away from big double-storey blocks to modular homes with different levels, cantilevered platforms and the use of wood, glass and steel."With clever design and no wasted space, it is very easy to fit four bedrooms into 200m ," said Reynolds.
