Lira s version of the film s first end-credit song, How Far I ll Go will feature in the South African version of Moana, which will be in cinemas this Friday. This is certainly one of the highlights of my year; it s a nice feather in the cap. I m really thrilled to be associated with Disney in this way, it s a fantastic song and in terms of my values, the song fits, Lira said. The film, Moana, is an animation about an adventurous teenager inspired to leave her island on a journey to save her people. Having only seen the trailers and based on the feedback from her family living in the US, Lira said she could relate to Moana and her unique character. You always have something that calls you towards what you are and who you are. My whole journey has been about following my bliss and what I think I m meant to do on this planet, which is what my music is about. Disney s Moana opens in cinema s nationwide this Friday and Lira s version of How Far I ll Go will be available to buy on iTunes from December 9.Check out some behind the scenes here:
