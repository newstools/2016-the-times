Wang mastered difficult conditions to record the lowest round of this year's tournament that included six birdies and an eagle on the 10th.The 21-year-old came close to equalling the course record 63, that is jointly held by Ernie Els (2002) and Swede Henrik Stenson (2008) but his round lost a bit of momentum between holes 12 and 17.Wang is on 11-under for the tournament and holds a three-shot advantage over South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen who looked set for superb round before things fell apart with bogeys at the 17th and 18th.Oosthuizen carded a two-under 70 but admitted Wang will take some catching in the final round. Three behind is a bit more work, sighed Oosthuizen. One behind would have been nicer. I'm gonna see if I can keep it together tomorrow and fire at a few pins. The windy conditions made the Gary Player Country Club even more treacherous than usual. The wind was even worse than yesterday. I played well and I would have been a lot calmer now if I was just one shot behind. I played nicely and I can't just look at the last two greens. It wasn't nice finishing like that but I am hitting it well. In those windy conditions I would have settled for eight under at the start of the day. I hit the ball well on the back stretch and I just got the pace wrong with the putt on the 17th. That made me scared on the one on 18. England's Andy Sullivan left it late but played himself among the front runners with three consecutive birdies on the closing holes. He is one shot behind Oosthuizen.South Africa's Brendan Grace was another back nine mover with three birdies on holes 12, 13 and 14 to be five-under for the tournament alongside second round leader Swede Alex Noren.They are a shot in front of Jaco van Zyl and another Swede Henrik Stenson. - TMG Digital
