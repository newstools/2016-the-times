Researchers at the University of Cape Town have found that hits are commonly used to settle disputes in everything from business to personal relationships.Mark Shaw and Kim Thomas examined 1000 cases in the past 16 years."Hits represent the application of targeted violence aimed at removing particular individuals and sending wider signals about power relations to promote a variety of political, economic or criminal interests," reads an extract from their research paper."Such killings, and the availability of killers for hire, draw on several 'nurseries of violence' and they link to wider sets of criminal activity, such as in the taxi industry, in gangs and organised crime, in the private security industry, as well as within state agencies."The paper, titled "The Commercialisation of Assassination: Hits and Contract Killing in South Africa 2000-2015", was published by the African Affairs Journal.Thomas said there were "many people who are willing to do anything for money" and hitmen could be hired for as little as R10,000 to have someone killed.On the political front there have been more than 50 killings in the past five years linked to political rivalry.Johan Burger, senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, said targeted killings were common in the highly competitive taxi industry.
