The metro on Monday morning tweeted a link to a schedule which shows that water will be cut to areas on every second night from 9pm to 5am.The city said on Friday that it has no choice but to take this drastic step as voluntary water saving measures by residents have averaged a savings rate of about 3.5% a week a far cry from the required 15% . Recent rains have not significantly improved water levels [therefore] the country needs good rainfall for an extended period to come out of the drought of recent years. If the night-time rationing measures do not achieve the required 15% reduction in usage the city will ration water during the day as well it said.Johannesburg Water which has had to cut supply to a number of areas recently as reservoirs run low tweeted on Sunday that: Water shedding/rationing is not happening in the @CityofJoburgZA.
