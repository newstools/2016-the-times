The South African Police Service will be deployed in force on the province s busiest traffic routes such as the N1 N3 and other highways."We will be addressing and clamping down on all forms of criminality and one of those would be to position ourselves and be visible on our roads. We will be having roadblocks en masse to address criminals in the roads and all sorts of road related crimes " said Brigadier Mathapelo Peters provincial head of corporate communications in Gauteng.She was speaking to TMG Digital on the sidelines at the launch of the Festive Season Operations in Gauteng on Wednesday at the Mall of Africa.Peters would not be drawn into divulging operational strategies for the roadblocks saying "but I can assure you we will be on the main routes coming into Gauteng and inside the town".She urged motorists not to be selfish by drinking and driving as it puts other innocent people's lives in danger and may result in a loss of lives due to that behaviour.Gauteng Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe De Lange also echoed Peters words pleading with the media to educate motorists about road safety."Members of the media please assist us in educating the public about the dangers of drinking and driving. Assist us in encouraging them to make prior arrangements and use alternative modes of transport in the event they have gone out partying " said De Lange.Malls and suburbs are the areas most targeted by criminals during the festive season.The South African Police Service in Gauteng has this year intensified its partnership-policing approach. It has joined heads and hands with other law enforcement agencies in the province and other government departments to ensure that this festive season runs smoothly.
