 The DA will request that Parliament s Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises summons Eskom CEO Brian Molefe as a matter of urgency so that he can tell the truth to South Africa about his relationship with the Guptas under oath the DA said in a statement on Sunday.The party said Molefe had conveniently attempted to evade explaining the revelations of the Public Protector s State Capture report during the media briefings the parastatal held after the report was released. In fact he has already blatantly misled South Africa when he said he wasn t provided with an opportunity to respond to the State Capture Report. The Public Protector s Office has confirmed that he did receive and respond to questions in writing.
