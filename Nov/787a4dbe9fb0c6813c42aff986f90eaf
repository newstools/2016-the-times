That is if the crowd that gathered outside the Cape Town High Court yesterday have their way. They sang: "Let Hlaudi lead" and waved banners that read: "Hlaudi is simply the best - hands off Hlaudi."The DA is asking the court to have Motsoeneng removed from the public broadcaster, arguing that he is an "unethical, manipulative fraudster who has destroyed any semblance of good corporate governance at the SABC".Controversial Cape Town councillor and Ses'Khona leader Andile Lili, infamous for throwing faeces in public spaces, including Cape Town International Airport, accused the DA of waging a racist attack on Motsoeneng."We said this from the beginning that Hlaudi is being targeted for his transformation stance at the SABC," said Lili."We are not interested in his qualifications; we are interested in the transformation of public institutions. The questions about the SABC board are immaterial."In court papers, Motsoeneng said his employment at the SABC had been beneficial to the broadcaster."I highlight that on my appointment as acting chief operations officer in 2011, I led a turnaround strategy that [overturned] the SABC's dismal financial state," he said. "Indeed, I mention that the first time the SABC realised any profit was in 2013 under my stewardship, when the SABC ended the financial year with a positive cash balance of R1.4-billion. I remain competent and able to discharge a function."The hearing continues.
