The auditor-general, Kimi Makwetu, reported that these entities failed to adhere to supply-chain management guidelines.Here's another staggering number: Only 30% of government entities received clean audits.It is not that difficult to achieve a clean audit. Here is the auditor-general's definition: "The financial statements are free from material misstatements (in other words, a financially unqualified audit opinion) and there are no material findings on reporting on performance objectives or non-compliance with legislation."That more than two in three government entities failed to overcome this simple hurdle is a disgrace.A further 72 government entities were issued with disclaimers.Here is the auditor-general's description of why an auditee receives a disclaimer: "The auditee provided insufficient evidence in the form of documentation on which to base an audit opinion."The lack of sufficient evidence is not confined to specific amounts, or represents a substantial portion of the information contained in the financial statements."In other words, nobody has any idea what the money was spent on - there is not enough documentation to conduct an audit and this applies to "a substantial portion" of the information emanating from government entities.Some entities, said Makwetu, did not have proper accounting systems.It is tempting to say that these government entities are being run like spaza shops, but that would do the local outlets a disservice.Spaza shops have to manage inventory, be responsive to customer demands and make a profit.These government entities do not deliver, are insensitive to the needs of the poor and are loss-making enterprises.
