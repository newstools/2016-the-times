The visitors crashed to 20/3 in the first eight overs and that after Faf du Plessis had won the toss and chosen to bat on a hard fast pitch.That marked the first time since the second match of the 2006 series in Sri Lanka that South Africa had lost three wickets inside 10 overs in the first innings of a test.They slumped to 32/4 before Du Plessis and Temba Bavuma took an extinguisher to the fire and limped to lunch on 78/4.And it could have been worse: Australia dropped catches that would have reduced to South Africa to 17/3 and 20/4.Mitchell Starc struck the first blow for the home side when he had Stephen Cook stunningly caught in the gully by a leaping Mitchell Marsh with an away swinger that rose sharply off the pitch.Josh Hazlewood removed Hashim Amla and Dean Elgar with the help of catches by Steve Smith at second slip and wicketkeeper Peter Nevill.South Africa s misery was complete when JP Duminy was given out caught behind to Peter Siddle despite no evidence of the ball deviating off his bat - except for a spike on the snickometre that could just as easily have been caused by the ball brushing his thigh pad.Patient carful batting by Du Plessis and Bavuma who faced 64 and 38 balls for their scores of 37 and 17 not out saw South Africa escape the session without further damage.Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj was selected to make his debut ahead of marginally more experienced left-arm wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi. - TMG Digital
