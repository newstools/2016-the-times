Viash Mohan was celebrating Diwali in Newcastle KwaZulu-Natal at the weekend when while allegedly unsupervised a firework was let off. A family member who asked not to be named said Viash had suffered broken facial bones burns to his face and severe hand injuries. He was subsequently moved to a hospital in Johannesburg. "He is fighting for his life in Milpark Hospital. We are not certain about the damage to his eyes. I am finding it so hard to accept what has happened " the family member said. Viash's father Valdez Mohan confirmed the incident. "We are in ICU. Recovery for him in three to six months. Cannot talk. Once this is over I will contact you " he said via text message yesterday. It is unclear how many other fireworks-related injuries occurred at the weekend with Netcare911 and ER24 paramedics saying none were reported to them. Attempts to get information from the KZN and Gauteng health departments were unsuccessful yesterday.- TMG Digital/The Times
