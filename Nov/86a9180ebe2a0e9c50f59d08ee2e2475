The party was responding to reports that Mkhwebane has laid a criminal charge against Madonsela following a complaint from Zuma.The Sunday Times quoted Mkhwebane as saying that she opened the case at the Brooklyn police station in Pretoria two weeks ago in connection with the "leaking" of an audiotape of an interview Madonsela had with Zuma during her "state capture" investigation.Madonsela who is out of the country has admitted to giving the audiotape of her interview with Zuma to news channel eNCA. The recording is damaging for Zuma because it disproves his claim that he was never given a chance to put forward his side of the story the newspaper said.The DA s spokesperson justice issues Adv Glynnis Breytenbach said on Sunday that while Zuma had every right to lodge a grievance with the public protector it was telling that Mkhwebane had jumped straight to criminal charges without conducting any further investigation. Zuma is also perfectly capable of laying a criminal charge against Madonsela if he feels aggrieved and should not rely on Mkhwebane to do so. That she did so speaks to a general attitude and pre-disposition to protect and act in the interest of Zuma and not in the interests of the people of South Africa Breytenbach said. This latest action only adds to an ever increasing list of worrying acts including changing all the locks at the PP offices and redeploying staff who worked closely with Madonsela to undermine and expunge the work of the former PP Breytenbach added.She said the DA did not support the appointment of Mkhwebane for numerous reasons one being that she had always been employed in and around government and indicated that she wanted to have a more friendly relationship with government . We are now seeing he consequences of her appointment. The capture of vital state institutions has become an ever present reality in South Africa. Only the Office to the PP and the Judiciary have remained relatively unblemished by capture. It now seems that the PP is well on her way to acting in favour of the politically compromised and elite Breytenbach said.
