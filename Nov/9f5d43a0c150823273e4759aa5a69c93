Netcare 911 spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said the man whom reports indicated had suffered severe injuries had been receiving medical care at a local medical facility in Nelspruit since Tuesday. The Netcare1 helicopter used in cases of life threatening emergencies was dispatched to Nelspruit earlier on Wednesday to airlift the critically injured man to a level 1 trauma facility in Johannesburg for further medical care. On board the helicopter was two Critical Care Assistants and an Emergency Care Practitioner to ensure that the man receives the best possible medical care. The man was intubated and loaded into the helicopter and thereafter flown to Johannesburg. The man is now admitted into a level 1 trauma unit in Johannesburg which is internationally renowned. The hospital is to date one of only two private hospitals accredited by the Trauma Society of South Africa Mathe said.
