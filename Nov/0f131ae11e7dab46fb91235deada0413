At 355 pages, there's no doubt you'll need a few glasses of wine. But good old Somizi, like many of us, jumped right in to try and find the juice.Unfortunately, like many of us, he found the experience as painful as having a kick to the face.Always finding the humour in a situation, he posted a video of a kid being hit in the face with a ball, explaining how the boy was like him "trying to read page 1 of 355 pages of the Thuli report".A video posted by Somizi (@somizi) on Nov 2, 2016 at 9:20am PDT A video posted by Somizi (@somizi) on Nov 2, 2016 at 9:20am PDTOh, we can relate, Somizi. We can relate!Of course, he wasn't the only celeb who made light of the report.DJ Tira joked that the report had released artist NaakMusiQ's new album. While DJ Cleo opened up about his feud with a former coach, who allegedly ran away with his gear, by altering the report to read "#KitCaptureReport." #KitCaptureReport #ThiefCoach #stateCaptureReport pic.twitter.com/0nQfTW1eBrNow, who said we don't live in the most entertaining country in the world?
