South Africa s private-hospital rate is 1888 tonsillectomies per 100,000 people 19 or younger well ahead of second-placed Northern Ireland with 850 per 100,000.Canada has the lowest rate of only 190 children per 100,000.According to a report produced by the UCT faculty of health sciences the difference in the training of ear nose and throat surgeons lack of consensus among professionals about managing throat infections social and family factors and the private healthcare funding models all contribute to the high tonsillectomy rate. It s easy to think that the higher burden of disease in South Africa could be a reason for so many tonsillectomies but that doesn t seem to be supported by evidence says the report s co-author Paul Douglas-Jones. It is conceivable that over-servicing in the private sector is a temptation but that was not investigated in the study. Clients who are paying a fee might also feel like they can dictate to doctors and might push for the procedure if they think it is in the best interests of their child. Douglas-Jones said that the patients who satisfied the criteria for a tonsillectomy were likely to benefit from the procedure.Evidence showed that patients who had the procedure would be healthier but the benefits were modest.Ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist Dr Martin Young said that only a small number of patients unequivocally needed the surgery but that many requested it. The majority of patients have made up their mind and want it done. In my view it is a wonderful surgical procedure but it isn t always necessary. Douglas-Jones said there was little agreement among ENT specialists pediatricians and GPs about what indications would justify a tonsillectomy.
