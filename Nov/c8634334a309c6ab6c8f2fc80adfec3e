The Johannesburg High Court said it needed more time to consider arguments in an urgent application brought by about 3000 students to have exams deferred to next year, or at least postponed by a fortnight.Students argued they had not been allowed sufficient time and support to prepare for the examinations because of the recent violent fees protests.Judge Willem van der Linde, however, said he would only be able to deliver a judgment tomorrow after considering both parties' arguments.Garth Hulley SC, on behalf of students, argued that the students weren't opposed to writing exams, but the university had "underestimated the psychological trauma" students had experienced with a large police and security presence on campus.Hulley argued that the university's stance that students could apply for a deferred exam was flawed, because they were required to vacate university residences and could only return once they were due to write.The university's stance is that students who are willing to write deferred exams have to vacate their residences by Saturday.They will only be allowed to return on November 26 for the exams, which are scheduled for the first week of next month.Hulley said many students would be disadvantaged as a result of this decision.Wits University senior counsel Hamilton Maenetje argued that the students wanted to change their case at the last minute."There are many students in similar or different positions who have already applied for and been granted deferred exams," he said."The rules are simple. If you're not writing exams you have to vacate your residence."Maenetje explained that there were additional costs that the university would incur if it had to remain open.
