News that Goddard a pre-unity captain of the all-white South African team had died on Friday reached Adelaide on Saturday during the second day of the third test.Former test batsman Daryll Cullinan posted on social media on Saturday that Goddard who captained South Africa in 13 of his 41 tests was a well-loved and respected cricketer . I hope he will be acknowledged with black armbands in Adelaide tomorrow. Cullinan wrote.When the South Africans appeared on Sunday they duly wore black armbands.But Cricket South Africa communications head Altaaf Kazi explained that the armbands were worn at the request of Cricket Australia to mark the second anniversary of the death of Phil Hughes who was killed by a bouncer while batting in a Sheffield Shield match in Sydney.Kazi was unsure how many if any of the South Africans were also remembering Goddard.That would not have answered the question former test batsman Barry Richards asked on social media: Glad (they re) remembering Phil Hughes. Trevor Goddard as well I hope? Kazi said the South African team s standing policy was to wear black armbands only when family members or others close to the team died.The wearing or not of armbands to mark the death of apartheid-era figures in cricket has become a point of political difference in the game in South Africa.TMG Digital
