 We are however disturbed that he chose to resign in January as we expected an immediate resignation with his team which was in some way improperly behaved during their incumbency the PAC said in a statement on Friday.Molefe announced his resignation on Friday following the release of the public protector s "State of Capture" report which made observations about the conduct of Eskom in awarding questionable coal supply contracts to Gupta-owned Tegeta Resources and Exploration.The PAC said it was concerned about a lack of leadership in the country but that Molefe had shown bold leadership in resigning. The party added that it would like leaders in other parastatals government departments and institutions to emulate Molefe s decision. A leader should not wait for the followers to remove them; they should voluntarily act by doing the right thing.
