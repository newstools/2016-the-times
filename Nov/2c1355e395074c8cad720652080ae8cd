That was the question posed by the Democratic Alliance on Friday which said the voting records showed that among MPs who did not cast a vote were Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi.Zuma attended a party caucus meeting before the rowdy motion of no confidence debate and vote on Thursday the Times reported on Friday.The caucus was addressed by staunch Zuma backer Jessie Duarte. There was speculation that Zuma was present to ensure that a divided caucus would toe the party line and blocked the DA-sponsored motion but this was denied by ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa. It is no secret that many of these absent ANC MPs had spoken out against President Zuma or against his poor leadership of our country before the vote said DA spokesman Phumzile van Damme.She said the absent MPs included: Pravin Gordhan Mathole Motshekga Aaron Motsoaledi Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Mike Masutha Nomaindia Mfeketo Mildred Oliphant Pam Tshwete Cedrick Frolick and Llewellyn Landers.Motsoaledi previously spoke out when Gordhan faced prosecution and there was a public outcry saying: It s not because it s Pravin but because I don t believe this should happen to anybody. Madikizela-Mandela and Mathole Motshekga have also voiced opinions about the leadership of the party.Van Damme said the DA would request leave records for the 35 ANC MPs to establish why they were absent.
