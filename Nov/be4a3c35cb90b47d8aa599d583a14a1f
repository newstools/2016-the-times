 An unconventional attempt to table of motion of no confidence in Jacob Zuma at this weekend s meeting of the NEC was defeated convincingly once again illustrating that the na ve belief that the ANC can self-correct is simply untrue. It quite clearly shows that the ANC still supports Zuma and support him fully. That is because Jacob Zuma is not an anomaly within the ANC he is the norm: he is only the most vivid manifestation of what the ANC has become - an irredeemable and toxic mix of corruption cronyism and nepotism Maimane asserted.Furthermore despite the brave face and united fa ade depicted by ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe the ANC is more divided now than it has ever been and this will only worsen Maimane said.This divide is between the majority of the ANC who envisage the National Democratic Revolution (NDR) as a means to self-enrich and a small minority without a voice who are unsuccessfully trying to uphold the Constitution and the Rule of Law.Zuma clearly holds all the power in the ANC and the majority of the ANC believe that he is the right man to take them forward Maimane added. We can never trust an ANC that keep Zuma through all he has done. While the ANC continues to fight amongst themselves our economy is hanging by a thread. The fact that the majority of the ANC NEC members chose paychecks and power over the people of South Africa requires the country to accept that the only way to stop the decay and get our country moving forward again is to remove the ANC once and for all. Moreover this once again shows that Parliament and not Luthuli House must do its job and remove Jacob Zuma once and for all Maimane stated.
