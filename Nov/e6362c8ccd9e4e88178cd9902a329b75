Etzebeth was last month linked to a move to Saracens but that move fell through.It now looks as if the giant second rower will definitely play club rugby somewhere in Britain following the current tour to England Italy and Wales.The Boks meet England at Twickenham on Saturday and Etzebeth is expected to be a key player for the visitors as they try to stretch their unbeaten record against England to 13 matches since 2006.Etzebeth has been capped 53 times at Test level but only 42 times at Super Rugby level and will take up a three-month contract at an unspecified club. Eben Etzebeth playing up here would be a great experience for him because he would be playing against top quality locks in the northern hemisphere game Coetzee said. He has played against the best in the southern hemisphere. The conditions would be different and he would learn from it. But on the other hand it wouldn t be good for the Springboks because Eben would be missing out on a conditioning phase."He would go straight from English club rugby in Super Rugby and then the June Tests next year and so on. Hopefully it will only be for this year. But I can assure you it is definitely going to happen. I m not sure which club he will join though. Etzebeth was unavailable for comment.Meanwhile the Boks have injury problems to contend with after openside flank Roelof Smit was ruled out of the tour with a torn bicep on Monday.Smit sustained the injury at training at the Latymer School near the Boks base in Kensington plunging the squad into an openside crisis just days before the Twickenham Test against England on Saturday- TMG Digital
