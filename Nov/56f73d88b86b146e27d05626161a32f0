Taking to Instagram, Judith lambasted herself for sleeping in instead of hitting the road."I already have 3 Marathons for next year, but today I am so lazy I just slept, did NOTHING. I must and will train. Not training is a sin."The singer has previously said that she has always focused on her health, explaining that she takes gym gear whenever she travels."Even from the days that I was in varsity, we used to train a lot, but when I got married and started having babies, I tried to train and it didn't work. So when I had enough of the babies, I decided to really work on myself," she said.Okay, we're still trying to get over the 3 marathons bit.That's next level.
