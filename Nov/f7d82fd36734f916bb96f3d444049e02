South Africa and Senegal have been regular combatants down the years, but have met just twice in competitive fixtures, both at the Africa Cup of Nations finals.Their only previous victory in seven meetings was last year in the Nelson Mandela Challenge, for all intents and purposes a friendly, as Mpho Makola scored on debut to give Shakes Mashaba a 1-0 win.That Senegal side was under-strength as well and coach Aliou Cisse has brought a more powerful side for this weekend's clash in Polokwane as his side seek to take control of the group ahead of a 10-month break between qualifiers.Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba warned his team must concentrate to the end to avoid a repeat of an Africa Cup of Nations meeting with Senegal two years ago.Coach Aliou Cisse, captain of Senegal's 2002 World Cup quarterfinalist team, has included star forwards Mame Biram Diouf (Stoke City), Sadio Mane (Liverpool) and Diao Balde (Lazio) for a qualifier that both teams know could make or break their chances of reaching Russia 2018.Bafana have played Senegal twice in Mashaba's latest stint as SA coach.
