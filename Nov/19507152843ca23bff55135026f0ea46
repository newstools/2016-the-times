This comes as a few students have accused UJ's Irhon Rensburg of corruption and militarizing the university with private security and bouncers."UJ issues concern us as the mother body of the EFF and we are interested in this particular struggle " said EFF deputy chairperson in Gauteng Mandisa Mashego."we have a very specific interest from the point of view of corruption allegations that have been persistently leveled by students against the vice-chancellor." She was addressing a group of students who had gathered at a park not far from the APK Campus. The students met at this venue to strategise a way forward after being prevented from handing over a memorandum of demands to Rensburg.Mashego said Saturday's murder of UJ student Kelvin Baloyi at a private residence highlighted "the issue of insecurity for students especially those black female students who continue to face insecure conditions at all campuses of UJ".Mashego who is also a member of the provincial legislature in Gauteng urged students to take "substantive action" against Rensburg. She said students should open a case of corruption and any other allegation or accusation that has been brought against the vice chancellor.She encouraged students to stand in solidarity at the funeral of Baloyi 21 who was shot and killed in the early hours of Saturday morning allegedly after an argument with a security guard. The company managing the private residence has denied the suspect is employed by its security contractor. - TMG Digital
