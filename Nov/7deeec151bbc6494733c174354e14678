 This comes as students accused the institution of protecting the alleged rapist saying that when the victim reported the matter to residence management and security they protected the alleged perpetrator."The University received a complaint about an alleged rape at the Wits Junction residence complex recently. The University has worked with the complainant for the last few weeks and the nature of this engagement is confidential. We urge everyone to respect the confidentiality and integrity of the complainant who is our first priority " said Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel in a statement.It is believed the female student tried to commit suicide allegedly because management ignored her plea and allowed the suspected rapist to remain on campus as he was writing exams. She has apparently left the country and dropped out of the institution.Patel said the matter was currently being investigated by the Gender Equity Office in line with the University s Sexual Harassment Sexual Assault and Rape Policy."We hope that the confidentiality with which we are managing this complaint serves as evidence that we will be responsive to every individual complainant in need. We urge anyone who has been the victim of gender based harm at Wits to report these incidents immediately to the Gender Equity Office " added Patel.Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela said they were alerted to the rape on Wednesday night when a group of students confronted Wits Management and accused them of protecting the perpetrator.The police have urged anyone with information to come forward and report the perpetrator.- TMG Digtial
