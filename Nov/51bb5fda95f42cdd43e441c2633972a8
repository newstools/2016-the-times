 That was the case when Mamelodi Sundowns set the record straight with a 3-0 hammering of their bogey side Golden Arrows without the services of Keagan Dolly and Khama Billiat on Wednesday night.With Sibusiso Vilakazi starting to find the form that made him the most wanted footballer in the country alongside Themba Zwane's underrated industry, it's the kind of selection headache every coach welcomes.The football world Pitso Mosimane lives in means he needs to deal with these problems and knows there has to be life without his two stars. They need all the rest they can get ahead of next month's Club World Cup in Japan."The problem we have with the injuries we are getting is that they are fatigue related, which is often the case with muscle injuries. Khama has a groin problem and Keagan has got shin splints. Those come from overuse. Tebogo Langerman is the one we've abused the most and if we could make four subs, he would have come off but I had to make three," Mosimane said."We've got enough personnel not to worry about Khama and Keagan's recovery and we cannot complain because we've got the Japan trip we need to prepare for. Zwane must play because he comes in and scores. Mzikayise Mashaba must play and Leonardo Castro must play."Gordon Igesund's Highlands Park lie in wait on Sunday in what will be the only league match."Are Highlands Park going to sit back? I don't quite know with that team but we have to play to score. Any team will be happy to get a point here," Mosimane said.
