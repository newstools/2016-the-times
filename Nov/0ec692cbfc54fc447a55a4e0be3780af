"The president has considered and also sought legal advice on the contents of the report as well as the remedial action to be taken " spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga said."The legal advice given and which advice has been accepted by the president are to take the remedial action on review."Madonsela s state capture report which was released last month found that Zuma may have breached his executive code of ethics and may be conflicted over his son Duduzane's relationship with the Gupta family.In her remedial action Madonsela directed that a commission of inquiry into the allegations of state capture be conducted and that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng appoint the sole judge to preside over the commission.On Friday the Presidency said Zuma's legal team was working on the review application which would be filed in the high court in Pretoria within the time periods prescribed by law.The basis for the review will be set out in the review application.
