Maimane was speaking yesterday during a debate on the decision by national director of public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams to charge Gordhan.The South African economy is reported to have lost R50-billion as a result of Abrahams's decison.Maimane said Abrahams, derided by his critics as "Shaun the Sheep", was a "wolf in sheep's clothing"."Abrahams immediately dropped the charges against [senior NPA prosecutors Nomgcobo] Jiba and [Lawrence] Mrwebi before setting his sights on the one man standing between the president and access to our Treasury - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan," said Maimane."This is a fight that has sent our economy on a downward spiral, and has led to numerous backtracks by Abrahams every time his agenda is exposed for what it is."Maimane said parliament should change the way the head of the NPA is appointed to "limit the powers of all future presidents".
