 The video, posted to Kruger Sightings YouTube account, was filmed by Rina van Heerden during a visit to Mabalingwe. After all the years of visiting Mabalingwe and other reserves this was definitely a first. We were on an early morning game drive and stopped to watch some animals. Out of the blue a male ostrich came out from behind our vehicle and started this really interesting mating dance. We were all super excited to be witnessing this. The game ranger told us that this is not something one sees easily."According to Van Heerden, after his performance the male just got up and left.
