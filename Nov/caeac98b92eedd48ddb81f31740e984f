Ecclestone, 86, believes F1 would appeal more to modern audiences, sponsors and advertisers if there were two 40-minute races, separated by a gap during which drivers could be interviewed.But he questioned whether the sport's decision-makers have the "courage" to make such a seismic change."People have a much shorter attention span and a lot of sports are looking at introducing shorter forms of their games," said Ecclestone."The television audiences went up for Brazil. We had a long race and a couple of crashes, but that meant we had two starts because of the red flags and people tuned in."Cars would qualify on a Saturday as usual for the first race and that would set the grid for the second. It would shake things up with lighter, faster cars."
