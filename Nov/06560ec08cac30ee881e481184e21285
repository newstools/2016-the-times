He had launched an application in the North Gauteng High Court seeking to interdict the report. The basis of the application as originally contended was that the President was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to provide meaningful input into the investigation and asked the court to be given an opportunity to do so."In short the President contended that: He has a right to be provided with incriminating evidence before he answers the questions posed to him. He is entitled to question witnesses as determined by the Public Protector which witnesses appeared before the Public Protector."When the application was launched it was not clear whether the investigation was finalised. The Public Protector has since clarified that the Report was signed and finalised by the former Public Protector on 14 October 2016. The Constitution provides that everyone has the right to administrative action that is lawful reasonable and procedurally fair."In the interest of justice and speedy resolution of the matter the President decided to withdraw his application."The President will give consideration to the contents of the report in order to ascertain whether it should be a subject of a court challenge " the presidency said in a statement.
