\Mbeki wrote the letter to Zuma expressing concern over state of affairs in the country. But the letter was leaked to the media and Zuma read it while in Harare.Reporting on the outcomes of the national working committee (NWC) of the ANC on Tuesday Mantashe said We don t think it is correct to write a letter to your successor and that letter ends up in the media .dsa That is all we are saying. Comrade Mbeki must advise Comrade Zuma quietly and even meet him if need be and engage him one-on-one. That advice will help the ANC. While Mantashe did not go so far as to identify who had leaked the letter he shared his suspicions on the matter. The person who is almost acting as secretary there [the ANC stalwarts] is Reverend [Frank] Chikane. Every letter he has sent to us he released to the media Mantashe said.The NWC is expected to meet the stalwarts of the ANC on a yet-to-be confirmed day.On the call for the ANC MPs to vote with their conscience in Thursday's Democratic Alliance-backed no confidence motion in Zuma Mantashe replied I do not expect any member of the opposition parties to vote according to their conscience. I am expecting them to vote according to the position of their parties. The MPs of the ANC are in Parliament. They will have a caucus take a position and vote according to their own party caucus position. [The motion] is not intended to help the ANC. It is part of the narrative to hurt it further. - TMG Digital
