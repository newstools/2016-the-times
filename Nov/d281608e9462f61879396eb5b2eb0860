Hlongwane was at the centre of the South African arms deal scandal and, more recently, identified as the "fixer" who took Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas to meet the Gupta brothers last year.In a report published on The Guardian website on Monday, a confidential contract shows that in 2005 Rolls-Royce signed up Hlongwane as a commercial consultant to promote its business in South Africa.The Guardian report says: "Hlongwane has previously denied that he or his companies have been involved in any corruption or wrongdoing."He has not been prosecuted for any offences and did not respond to a request for comment."The contract naming Hlongwane was among leaked documents and testimony from insiders uncovered in an investigation by The Guardian and the BBC. They suggest that Rolls-Royce may have benefited from the use of illicit payments to boost profits for years.According to the website, the network of agents is now the focus of large-scale investigations by anti-corruption agencies in the UK and the US."The Guardian understands the inquiries are looking into specific allegations that these hired intermediaries were bribing people," it says."Rolls-Royce, which sells turbines and engines for passenger jets and military aircraft and is worth an estimated 13-billion, declined to answer detailed questions."In April the Sunday Times reported that Hlongwane had been identified as the "fixer" who took Jonas to meet the Guptas last year.The Sunday Times reported: "A number of insiders with intimate knowledge of the meeting revealed that it was Hlongwane who arranged the meeting at a Sandton hotel where Jonas was offered the finance minister post while Nhlanhla Nene was still in office."The paper quoted an ANC insider as saying Hlongwane was a regular visitor at the Gupta compound in Saxonwold, northern Johannesburg, and was close to President Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane, who is also a business associate of the Guptas.The report further stated: "Hlongwane is also a business partner to the president's former legal adviser, advocate Linda Makatini, a business associate of [Zuma's son] Duduzane's at Deviate Information Technology."At the time of publication, Hlongwane didn't respond to requests for comment from the Sunday Times.Attempts by TMG Digital to get comment from him on the Rolls-Royce claims were unsuccessful.Hlongwane was cleared of any wrongdoing by the Seriti Commission of Inquiry into the arms deal.He was alleged to have been a middleman in some deals when he served as an adviser to the late defence minister Joe Modise.
