The organisations made this remark in their replying affidavit and heads of argument in their application to compel Zuma to suspend Abrahams and two other senior prosecutors pending an enquiry into their fitness to hold office.The organisations said these suspensions and inquiries became necessary as a result of the circumstances surrounding the issuing and withdrawal of trumped up criminal charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and others.They said these actions had disastrous consequences for the administration of justice and the economy.In his answering papers on Tuesday Zuma said that utter incompetence recklessness and misconduct on the part of the prosecutors were not grounds warranting a suspension or institution of a disciplinary inquiry. Zuma also said he has given the prosecutors until November 28 to make representations to him as to why he should not suspend them.The organisations said it was unclear why these extensive representations were sought from the prosecutors when the opportunity to make full submissions on the merits will be at the disciplinary inquiry.Zuma had also not said when the decision to suspend them would be made. It seems therefore that the president intends for reasons he has not explained to draw out and delay the process unnecessarily and unlawfully. This is particularly unacceptable in circumstances where he has clearly misconstrued his powers and has closed his mind on the topic of suspension and enquiry the organisations said.The matter is set to be heard next by the high court in Pretoria next Thursday.
