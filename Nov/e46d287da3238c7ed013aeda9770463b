The first was launched at the Matthew Goniwe School of Leadership and Governance in Benoni.Deputy Basic Education Minister Enver Surty said at the launch that delivery of quality public education could not be delayed any further."We firmly hold a view that the classroom is the centrepiece of learning and teaching," he said.The initiative is the product of a partnership between distance learning institute Unisa and the Department of Higher Education and Training."The centres will train educators in innovative technological teaching methods," said Department of Education spokesman Elijah Mhlanga.He said the centres would use information communication technology to strengthen teaching, knowledge and administration in the education system.Surty added that it was no longer sufficient for teachers to only impart content knowledge and that the centres would encourage higher levels of quality education.The development centre's programme will use digital learning for teachers who will have access to digital tools with internet connectivity.
