"Look at my bestie y'all! !! This is what it means to be blessed in abundance. I remember the first time she was on a magazine cover of Drum and they made her wear all these hideous clothing and stupid make-up. It broke my heart that they just won't let her be. Now Look at God. Look at her smile. Look at her comfort. Look at her confidence. Look at her shine," wrote Lungile Luh Maquba on Instagram.We are slayed! We are team Cobra. We are Caster! via GIPHY
