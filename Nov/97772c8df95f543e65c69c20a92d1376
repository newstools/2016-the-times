In an angry statement on Thursday, the union federation launched a scathing attack on the ANC, accusing it of taking the support of workers for granted and repeatedly reneging on promises to implement pro-worker policies.Cosatu said the government, under the leadership of President Jacob Zuma, had failed to deliver on the implementation of the comprehensive social security system, the national health insurance scheme, and a national minimum wage."Cosatu is equally tired of the ANC government's many failures and broken promises, and the condescension and arrogance of some ANC leaders, who dismiss Cosatu and workers' legitimate demands," said national spokesman Sizwe Pamla.The aspirations of the working class have to be reflected in the ANC and its government, says Cosatu, and if it rejects or dishonours those aspirations it is turning its back on the workers.Although Cosatu confined itself to worker-related issues in its rebuke, this could be seen as a sign that it no longer had confidence in Zuma's leadership.Cosatu has not pronounced on its preferred candidate to take over from Zuma next year.Its biggest affiliate, Nehawu, this week called for Zuma to resign.
