To start with, there are the difficulties of having an estimated 350 overseas South African players, including 11 of the squad to face England at Twickenham next week, meaning that Eddie Jones will have had a full extra week of preparation with his squad.Then there is that viper's nest of petty and party politics that Duane Vermeulen referred to last week in his interview with The Daily Telegraph.And, at the highest level, South Africa's sports ministry has imposed 'transformation targets' decreeing that, by 2019, Springbok match-day squads must be 60% blacks. The pressure is all consuming."As assistant coach, you can just demand what you want but as a head coach you've got to look at the holistic thing."Managing people, players, you've got to manage upwards and downwards," Coetzee says.He has already discovered the size of his task after petitions were launched for his resignation following the record 57-15 defeat by New Zealand, their fifth loss in nine matches this year.While he displays admirable honesty about certain challenges, he chooses not to frame the transformation targets as a quota to be filled, but as a means of changing ingrained attitudes."You never hear the good things about transformation or where the players that people have really accepted and bought into it," Coetzee says."If it's managed correctly, and properly and it's not just a matter of numbers, it's changing mindsets and perceptions. That is what transformation is about."No player wants to play because of his skin colour, and I'll never do that, that's the biggest injustice that you can do to a player to select him based on his skin colour."Never, ever will I allow that. But I am a firm believer in opportunity, giving all players opportunity that might not have been the case in the past."
