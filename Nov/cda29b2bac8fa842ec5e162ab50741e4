This was after party EFF leader Julius Malema told them that police had refused to open the gate into the lawns and that they should walk back to Church Square where they spent the morning and the previous night."Comrades we must now go back to the drawing board and decide when we will come back to the Union Buildings " said Malema. He accused the police of being criminals themselves for protecting a "criminal."Malema also briefed the crowd on the Public Protector's state capture report saying it would leave the party with no option but to go to court to force President Jacob Zuma to step down.The crowd estimated to number several thousand dispersed without any confrontation with the police. Use any street on your way to Church Square. Do not allow them to dictate which road to use. Tshwane is yours Malema said.Earlier the Saps' Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi had told Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu that they couldn't find the keys to unlock the handcuffs that they used to lock the gate to the grounds of the Union Buildings."Firstly I tried to find the guy who closed and we can't find him he's gone and that means we can't open this gate " said Mkhwanazi."Secondly I am told that you didn't apply to march to the Union Buildings. Your march wasn't supposed to come this side it was supposed to end at Church Square. So commander in chief if I open this gate it will be unlawful and wrong." - TMG Digital
