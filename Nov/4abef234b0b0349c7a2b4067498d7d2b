At least that's what Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi told EFF leader Julius Malema at the gate saying they would have to wait at least an hour to gain entry to the grounds."I'm trying to check which security guard locked the gate [with the handcuffs] and get him to open... If I can " said Mkhwanazi."I don't have a problem with opening the gate but all I need is an hour to track the security guard who has the key."Malema urged Mkhwanazi to speed up the process otherwise the City of Tshwane would continue to be shut down."You know very well that if you leave people in the way that are now we are going to end up with agitated people. We want to get people onto the lawns of the Union Buildings " said Malema.Malema"If you can't get the key get a grinder and cut this thing off. There is no one here with a bad intention. All we want is for [President Jacob] Zuma to go."Mkhwanazi then told Malema that Zuma was not at the Union Buildings. Malema replied that he was aware that Zuma wasn't present and that all they wanted was to send a message to him."This is the seat of government and we want to send a very clear message that the president must leave. That man is occupying this office " added Malema.There is a heavy armed police presence within the Union Buildings premises.A Saps vehicle carrying razor wire could be seen patrolling the park whilst a police water canon vehicle was standing behind the gate.Earlier police dispersed the crowd using rubber bullets and stun grenades. - TMG Digital
