These were a party statement said abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand and for making public statements which brought the ANC into disrepute .It s national disciplinary committee (NDC) found both charges to be very serious and suspended his ANC membership for 5 years . The NDC said that the charged member showed no political understanding of one of the fundamental objectives of the ANC viz the support for and advancement of women s emancipation the NDC said. As a provincial leader in the ANC he should have known about the triple oppression of South African women and the giant strides being made by the ANC to accord women their rights and help them to overcome their oppression. The statement also said Fransman deliberately misled the public when he said that he did not receive documents to enable him to prepare for his disciplinary hearing whereas in truth he was given all the relevant documents he needed to prepare his defence . The charged member did not attend the hearing and showed no remorse for his misconduct. Last week TMG Digital reported that Fransman sent his lawyer to the hearing that is set to continue on Friday.The party s integrity committee launched an investigation after Wynand reported the matter to police. It then recommended action against Fransman.The hearing which was chaired by Minister of Women in the Presidency Susan Shabangu was held behind closed doors at the Good Hope Building in Parliament.Leading the ANC s case was Uriel Abrahamse who successfully prosecuted Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema and who was ANC Youth League president at the time.In a statement on Thursday Fransman said among the reasons for not attending was ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe s failure to make good on promises to supply documents related to the hearing. I refuse to be part of a faction at Luthuli House s war of the jungle where there s disrespect for organisational protocols and where those who are giving support to this faction are supported irrespective of their wrongdoings he said.Mantashe declined to comment except to add: I don t want to be part of this and I didn t speak with Marius.
