The new party has opened branches in Gauteng. It will be launched this month.Mthandeni Zungu, the national convenor of the EEE, said "betrayed" supporters ditched the EFF after it entered into partnerships with the DA after the local government elections in August."The party failed to take us into its confidence and they just come down hard on us. The truth is they never supported the structures to mount an effective campaign," said Zungu.The national leadership of the EFF disbanded its KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape executive committees, and all regional structures in the two provinces, after the party's poor showing in this year's municipal polls.
