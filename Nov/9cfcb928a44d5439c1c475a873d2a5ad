Compuscan and Coremetrix, a UK-based company, will provide credit providers, financial services and insurance companies and risk managers with an alternative means of assessing the creditworthiness of consumers - through psychometric testing.Jacobus Eksteen, senior data analyst at Compuscan, said: "The implementation of this testing will open the door to credit for more consumers, enabling them to build a better credit record."However, affordability tests will still play an essential role in the granting of credit."There are many individuals who do not qualify for credit as they have no credit history. The testing will empower some of them to illustrate that they should not be viewed as having high risk."Psychometric testing is used in the UK, Poland, Turkey and Russia, and from next year will be adapted and implemented in South Africa.Chief economist at Econometrix, Azar Jammine, welcomed the development but said it should not be used as a "be all and end all" measurement for risk assessment.He said: "Theoretically, this could be very useful, but practically the system could be abused and therefore it should be used as one of many tests."The tests will be conducted after the standard affordability test and consumers will be required to answer questions related to how they handle different situations, brand associations, interests, means of transport and their outlook on life.Those applying for loans with online credit providers, life insurers or retailers could be taking psychometric tests either on their mobile devices or online.Eksteen said the tests would also allow for more accurate assessment in the insurance industry and could enable previously high-risk consumers to qualify based on positive test results.He said: "The test doesn't need to be conducted only in the case of a low credit score (high risk) or thin file (limited data), but can be used in conjunction with the traditional methods to provide a more holistic view of the consumer."If the score generated based on the psychometric test results is not high enough to overturn the original decision not to grant credit, the original reason will stand."Jammine said: "The concern is that fewer people would [qualify] for credit. In the short term that could negatively impact retailers but in the long term it could create a more sustainable environment for consumer spending."
