Right now, for any team to face Sundowns - who showed no signs of concentration problems coming down from the high of being crowned African champions last month - is no easy task."There was the desire from each set of players to overcome the other. But in the second half we dropped it a bit," Komphela said."The levels of confidence from Sundowns - they looked more confident as soon as they got the ball in one-on-ones - was something that we needed to deal with much better."I thought after we regained possession we needed to find [strikers] Mitchell Katsvairo and Lewis Macha a bit better, for them to hold the ball so everybody could come and join."
