His former Mamelodi Sundowns colleague Pitso Mosimane was among those who praised Chippa s disciplined passing game and the way they kept up a high intensity and held on to possession for long periods of the game. But it is now more than two months since Chippa last won a 4-1 away thumping of Baroka FC on September 28 and as Malesela s team prepare to host Cape Town City on Saturday they are on a five-match winless streak. It has taken off much of the recent lustre but Malesela is hoping an almost three-week break since their last game against table-topping Bidvest Wits will get them back to winning ways. The Fifa break gave us an opportunity to go back to the training ground and find solutions he said. Chippa sit at eighth in the Absa Premiership standings but have won two of their seven league games played. They lost 1-0 at Wits in their last encounter. We need to knuckle down and show the hunger to win games again. We lacked a bit of effort against Wits and at the end that was a difference between ourselves and them added the coach. We have a responsibility all of us here to defend the Chippa United emblem and take this project to greater heights. We have reminded the players of their bit on the field of play. Chippa host City at the Buffalo Stadium in East London. It is the first time this season Chippa play at the venue but will return to Port Elizabeth next Tuesday when they have Orlando Pirates as guests. - TMG Sport
