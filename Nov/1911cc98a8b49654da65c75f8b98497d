But fast forward to 2016 and the pair finally made peace.They seemed to have sealed the deal with a hug at Taboo nightclub in Johannesburg last month. The moment was captured by photographer Thembani ManganyiA photo posted by zintathu (@zintathu) on Oct 30, 2016 at 2:52am PDTA photo posted by zintathu (@zintathu) on Oct 30, 2016 at 2:52am PDTBut speaking to Slikour recently, Cassper revealed that the rappers had made peace several months before that, when they had decided to sit and talk about their differences."'That (the hug at Taboo) was not a moment (of unity) for me, because me and AKA had already spoken. The moment for me was when we sat down together. There were no pictures taken. That was the moment when we spoke about it and decided that we were cool and we've been cool ever since," Cassper said.In fact, after their chat, Cassper and AKA even ended up hanging out together in LA (during the BET Awards in June)."A few weeks later, we were in LA together... me and AKA were in LA, drunk and talking shit... Me and Kiernan have been cool for months," Cassper said.Cassper said that he made a conscious decision that things between him and AKA would be natural. That's why he didn't upload the picture of the two hugging to his social media accounts.He admits that there was a time when his crew were upset by AKA's Composure, and almost started a fight when it was played by a club DJ at Cassper's birthday party."I was even scared of celebrating because I was scared of offending people. Now, you're stuck in this hole, this dark room of assumptions. But in reality it was just an illusion," he added.Check out the full interview below.
