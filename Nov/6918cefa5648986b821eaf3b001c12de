Lamayne, 26, whose real name is Genesis Manney, hosted her first show for the station last week and will be broadcasting from the Cape Town-based studio every eight weeks."It's not your regular radio host job. I get to talk about whatever I want to talk about. It's uncensored," she said."I feel like there's always censorship on mainstream radio and The Eye TV is not like that."The Eye TV has been going for just three weeks after being launched by Jon Savage and Catherine Grenfell - known for their work at 5FM - and is in partnership with Cape Town-based Unknown Union, a store owned by California-born Jason Storey."I told Catherine I was looking for someone super smart, super talented, but also brave enough to speak about things that need to be spoken about fearlessly," said Savage."In less than three seconds, Catherine said 'Gigi Lamayne' and as the words came out of her mouth, I said: 'Yes! She's perfect.'"We think she was the obvious fit for what we are building with The Eye, which is an alternative to mainstream radio."Lamayne, who recently signed a deal with growing music label Mabala Noise, is a Wits University graduate who was a part of the #FeesMustFall movement.She has said she was a "student who struggled to get through university because of finances".She recently released her debut album #iGenesis digitally. She said she hoped it went gold as no female hip-hop artist had ever gone gold."I'm doing the #GigiGoesGold tour because a female rapper has never gone gold and that's crazy, so I'm launching the tour on the 25th of November and I'm also doing a social media competition to help an upcoming rapper by featuring them on my tour."Word on the street is that Eye TV's lineup will include a well-known politician as well as an Afrikaans singer; rumours which Savage said he could neither confirm nor deny.
