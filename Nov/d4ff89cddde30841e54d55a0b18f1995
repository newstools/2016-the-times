After a disastrous 2016 that has yielded only four wins in 11 Tests and included a first ever home loss against Ireland as well as a first defeat to Italy coach Allister Coetzee is set to ring the changes for the season finale. In what could be his last Test in charge it appears as if Coetzee is determined to at least go down swinging if indeed he is to go down at all. The likes of wing Jamba Ulengo centre Rohan Janse van Rensburg and flank Uzair Cassiem could all be in line for Test debuts. But others such as centre Lionel Mapoe scrumhalf Faf de Klerk and Piet van Zyl and flyhalf Elton Jantjies could also be included and all have played little or no rugby on this tour. Van Rensburg Ulengo and Van Zyl last played against the Barbarians three weeks ago while Cassiem has not played since the Currie Cup final in late October. De Klerk and Jantjies have only had a few minutes of rugby on tour and the same goes for Johan Goosen who is in line to start at fullback. I don t believe that lack of game time will be a problem this weekend forward s coach matt Proudfoot said. We have had a lot of hard chats so if a player has rust this weekend then he is in the wrong frame of mind. If he is worrying about making a mistake he mustn t. Making a single mistake this weekend is not going to win or lose us this game. Saturday s match is about how this team responds and what their attitude is like after a tough year. That is where we are directing our focus. - TMG Digital
