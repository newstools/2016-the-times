Strauss who celebrated his 31st birthday on Friday will lead the Boks for a 11th time against Italy on Saturday as one of the most difficult seasons in SA rugby history draws to a close.Strauss who was appointed as the 57th Bok captain in June made the announcement that he would retire on September 1 and in the interim nothing has changed. I m definitely still retiring Strauss said t the team s Florentine hotel. I m still very happy with my decision even though it wasn t an easy one to make. I would love to play for Boks forever or as long as I could. It s been a massive honour to play and captain SA but I said in my first presser as captain that I will always do what I think is in best interests of team. Its time for youngsters to step up and make positions their own. It s also time for new leaders to step up and develop. I m not going to name players who are possible future Bok captains. A couple of guys have put their hands up; there are franchise captains and also some overseas-based captains. I m not sure what the future policy on picking overseas-based players will be. Strauss will continue to play provincial rugby for the Bulls in next season but first he has to undergo a back operation.He has been managing a "wear and tear" issue and will probably have surgery in early December to fuse vertebrae. He said the injury was not a factor in his retirement decision though. It s not a career-threatening situation but an operation I need because of wear and tear Strauss said. My plan is to have one more season of Super Rugby with the Bulls and then reassess my future. Playing overseas is a possibility but I ll be just as happy to continue to play in SA. It may be several months before Strauss plays again - and he might miss the first part of the 2017 Super Rugby. - TMG Digital
