The ruling party in the province announced on Monday morning that DA ward councillor Clive Otis Lots and Merle Clayton Williams both from the Pietermaritzburg region would be returning to the ANC. Both were members of the ANC before crossing the floor a few years ago. Shortly afterwards KwaZulu-Natal DA leader Zwakele Mncwango downplayed the significance of their departure saying "Neither is a loss to the party". Lots said there was no place for coloureds in the DA. Williams explained that she had left the ANC because she was frustrated but those problems had been addressed. ANC provincial deputy chairman Willies Mchunu said more defections were expected. Mncwango said Lots was facing a disciplinary hearing on Friday for among other things allegedly leaking information related to elections to the ANC.Williams he said had resigned in September.- TMG Digital/The Times
