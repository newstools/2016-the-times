Carr is one of two changes to the starting lineup which also sees Bryan Habana return in place of JP Pietersen from the side that lost 37-21 to England at Twickenham last week. With lock Eben Etzebeth ruled out of the match due to concussion Pieter-Steph du Toit returns to the second row after playing flank a week ago. Carr will form a new back row with Willem Alberts moving to blindside flank after operating at openside last week and Warren Whiteley retaining his place at No 8. In all there are five changes to the 23-man squad.The bench shows three changes with prop Trevor Nyakane flank Teboho Mohoje and flyhalf Elton Jantjies taking the places of Lourens Adriaanse Carr and Lionel Mapoe respectively. Nizaam has played openside before and he was good off the bench last week coach Allister Coetzee said. We ve got to win the race to the ball this week. Italy go hard with low tackles and the next man in over the ball so we hope 'Nemo' [Carr] does well. Continuity is key and although we are not getting the results there is progress. We have kept the same combinations in an effort to continue building combinations at centre and halfback in particular. The changes on the bench are necessary because we need rotation and also to bring some impact. Eben [Etzebeth] is out so we had to make the change. I had to move Pieter-Steph to lock so he is a bit of utility forward at the moment. Limping Boks reading little into Italy s heavy defeat against All Blacks But he brings a huge work rate so we need him.
