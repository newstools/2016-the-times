In August last year Cassper took to Twitter to out AKA for slapping him at a club.AKA denied the claims, simply saying it wasn't true.But a few weeks later he did an about turn and admitted that he had slapped Cassper.Now, in an interview with Anele Mdoda on Real Talk, Cassper has detailed what happened."At that moment I wanted to fight back. I wanted to smash him."He said he comes to his senses very quickly and stepped back."People got between us. And as I looked into the situation I said 'this is not me.' I don't want to be known for this. Cassper Nyovest is a brand I respect. Kids will do anything I do. So if they hear about me fighting then they will fight."Their feud used to dominate news but last weekend Cassper, and AKA hugged it out, sending social media into a frenzy.
