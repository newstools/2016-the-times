The Western Cape education department says it has had to make more funding available as more schools apply for financial assistance."The department has this year made over R47.5-million available to assist schools struggling to collect fees from [the parents of] poorer learners," said Western Cape education MEC Debbie Schaffer.She said that every year the department received thousands of applications from the 569 schools at which fees were payable for fee exemptions.The department paid compensation to 91% of these schools in 2014 and to 96% in 2015, and will be paying 97% of them this year."It is evident that there is a growing number of parents who simply cannot afford to pay school fees. This is an unfortunate consequence of our ailing economy and puts a massive financial strain on fee-payment schools, which rely on the collection of fees for their running costs," said Schaffer.And the problem isn't confined to the Western Cape, say the heads of school governing bodies.In Gauteng, 20% to 40% of parents apply to their child's school for either partial or full fee exemption, said Kathy Callaghan, of the Governor's Alliance, which works in association with school governing bodies.Callaghan said parents are increasingly struggling to keep up with annual fee increases but many missed the opportunity to provide input on fee increases."Some parents do not attend the school annual general meetings at which fees are approved," she said.Teachers and principals in KwaZulu-Natal say parents are increasingly applying for fee exemptions and have questioned the effectiveness of the quintile system for ranking schools.In Gauteng, fee-charging quintile 4 and 5 schools receive about R590 a year for each pupil. No-fee schools, ranked as being in quintiles 1 to 3, get R1177."Our province is generally rural and you find that a school is ranked as quintile 4 or 5 and for that reason loses out. Teachers in rural schools lose out on the rural allowance."Sometimes two schools separated by only a fence belong to two different rankings," the KwaZulu-Natal secretary of the SA Democratic Teachers' Union, Nomarashiya Caluza, said, calling for the system to be reviewed."Priority is given to the first three quintiles, which is correct because those are schools regarded as the poorest of the poor."However, with the wrong quintiling, some qualifying schools lose out."The fee-payment schools find it difficult to enforce payment because very few parents, especially in rural areas, know about exemptions," said Caluza.Naven Govender principal of Brailsford Primary, in Phoenix, said fewer than half of the parents of his school's 468 pupils paid their fees this year.Brailsford is ranked as quintile five, on a par with model-C schools.Judy Dlamini, the KwaZulu-Natal education department's deputy director-general, said many pupils from poor families attend quintile 4 and 5 schools."If a parent doesn't apply for exemption it puts a school in a difficult position," said Dlamini.Government and private schools contacted by The Times indicated that there would be fee increases of between 6% and 10% for the 2017 school year.The CEO of the National Governing Body Foundation, Tim Gordon, said that despite the financial strain on parents of high school and primary school children, the national focus was on university funding."With society very largely committed to finding funding for the #FeesMustFall initiative, it would appear at present that schools will have very little room for manoeuvre in this regard," he said."Those agitating for fee decreases in schools need to be aware of the realities that education will face if such a concept were to be widely implemented."
