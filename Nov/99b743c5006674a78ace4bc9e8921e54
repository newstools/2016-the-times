It shows how difficult it is to break these patterns. Soudien added: There are some gains but we are facing obstinate obstacles. We are not seeing the changes needed. The Western Cape province overall had the best result with Gauteng just behind it while the North West Limpopo and Eastern Cape were the lowest performing provinces.
