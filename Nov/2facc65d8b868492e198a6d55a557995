Pearl, like many of us, grew up watching the US TV sitcom Roseanne, and so when she bumped into the show's John Goodman at a restaurant recently, she couldn't help but freak out.In case you forgot, this is him: No doubt dying inside, Pearl took to Twitter to give a running commentary of her encounter with the popular TV veteran. And we think it's safe to say that she was dying inside.When John Goodman is right next to you at restaurant and you gotta act cool because you're tryna be a cool New Yorker.

DAWG !!!! I'm SOOOOO STRESSED !!!!! https://t.co/depWMfbWetUnfortunately, "cool New Yorker" Pearl didn't ask John for a selfie - but she did apparently get her feels all over her salad.Guys. I'm gonna leave John Goodman alone. It's so hard but let me be fresh rather. Although my feels are all over my salad PEARL THUSI (@PearlThusi) November 3, 2016Guys. I'm gonna leave John Goodman alone. It's so hard but let me be fresh rather. Although my feels are all over my salad This probably won't be the last time that Pearl casually bumps into a Hollywood star - so she should probably work on that "being cool" thing.But she said that if she ever met Viola Davis or Meryl Streep it would probably just be game over for her.If I bumped into Viola Davis or Meryl Streep I'd just evaporate. It's that simple. PEARL THUSI (@PearlThusi) November 3, 2016If I bumped into Viola Davis or Meryl Streep I'd just evaporate.
