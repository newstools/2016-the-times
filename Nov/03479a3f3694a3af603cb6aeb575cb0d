Regulators say buying drugs online is risky, but submissions at a recent medical conference suggest treatment sourced via buyers' clubs can be as effective as that from conventional channels.HIV activist Will Nutland, who supports a drug-buying network in London and takes Indian-made generic drugs not available through the health service to avert HIV infection, said the latest research would build confidence in such schemes."This new data shows that so far we've got it right," he said.Buyers' club websites act as middlemen, providing details of online pharmacies and drug makers, using a loophole in World Trade Organisation patent rules allowing small imports for personal use.Like Ron Woodroof, the 1980s Aids patient in the Dallas Buyers Club film, sponsors of today's drug clubs aim to help patients who cannot get the drugs they want through local healthcare systems by importing medicines.But while Woodroof had to smuggle drugs across the Mexican border, users of modern-day clubs can, in many countries, tap orders into their computers legally and at far lower prices.
