The marriage is seen as way for the prince who was recently appointed as acting king by a faction of the amaDlomo family of abaThembu to solidify his plans of ascending to the throne.For a leader to be fully recognised in the traditional African setting they must have a wife.The 24-year-old prince was in a jubilant mood after the arrival of uduli (the bride s delegation) on Thursday night.The traditional wedding took off with the arrival of the 19-year-old bride in a convoy of more than 20 cars and a bus from Ncorha Flats near Cofimvaba.They sang danced and ululated the whole night.At about 5.45am today the bride accompanied by a group of nine other women wearing traditional gear walked to the river to fetch fresh water.Other traditional wedding rituals and festivities started at about noon today. - DispatchLIVE
