Mosimane confirmed that the duo are unlikely to feature in Sunday afternoon s Absa Premiership game against Highland Park at Loftus Versfeld Stadium.The reigning African Champions won their third match in a row as they strolled past Lamontville Golden Arrows 3-0 at Loftus on Wednesday without Billiat and Dolly.Billiat is currently nursing a groin injury he came back with after returning to club action from the international break while Dolly hobbled off the pitch in a 2-1 win over arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday with shin splints.To have to make do without players of such quality and creativity would have given other coaches sleepless nights but not the Sundowns coach. Nah Sunday no no we don t need them was Mosimane s answer when asked if he expected Billiat and Dolly to feature against Highlands on Sunday.Mosimane kept to his cycle of rotating players for exposure and fitness purposes ahead of their participation in the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan next week.The tournament runs from December 8 18. The bigger picture is Japan my friend."We have enough personnel to deal with Highalands we have enough personnel we can't complain said Mosimane.Themba Zwane started in place of Dolly against Arrows and managed to get on the score sheet.Hlompho Kekana and Sibusiso Vilakazi were also on target against Arrows.With Sundowns leading 3-0 against Highlands Mosimane brought on Mziyikayise Mashaba who hasn t played much as he was recovering from an injury for Anthony Laffor. The guys who are there must play."Zwane must play he comes in and he scores very good."He must play he must score. Mashaba must play Leo must get more game time."Teko Modise who was seated in the Loftus grand stand when Sundowns beat Chiefs also got a run after replacing Vilakazi.Percy Tau was Mosimane s last substitution against Arrows as he made way for Leonardo Castro who himself is still trying to return to full match fitness levels after a few months out. You can see my substitutions are not about tactics."I wanted to give Leo game time because I want to build them up and give them game time for Japan. I need to give Mashaba game time and I did that so that he can recover because he hasn't been playing. You could see Leo and Mashaba are little bit rusty."I think Leo had a chance to score but he was na ve and gave the ball to Zwane on the other side. Teko was in the grand stand when we played Chiefs on Saturday so I have to give him a chance to play and he came he played."I put Zwane also because he hasn't been playing added Mosimane.Key defender Anele Ngcongca is still nursing a knee injury and is yet to play since joining in the off-season.Siyanda Zwane is still out with a shoulder injury and another defender Bangaly Soumahor remains sidelined with a groin problem. - TMG Digital
