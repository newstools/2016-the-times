Abafana Bes'thende beat Highlands 1-0 through a Danny Phiri 86th minute goal at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Sunday putting in a scintillating second half performance to claim their fifth win in nine encounters. I thought the first 20 minutes we were very poor you know. We had a game plan to play the ball behind a very high defence that lacks a bit of speed Larsen told reporters after the match. I think there was one moment (Vuyani) Ntanga played the ball to (Lerato) Lamola and that was an example of what we were looking for and we didn't have enough forward movement. But (in the) second half I thought there was really only one team in it I thought that we could have scored a handful of goals. I thought they (Highlands) started tiring in the second half and we got stronger. So I think our conditioning is on point. Like I said I can't be more proud of my boys than I am today said Larsen.Arrows are now placed second on the log with 17 points from nine matches. They are two points behind leaders Bidvest Wits who have played two games less. Danny Phiri and Musa Bilankulu in the middle of the park really gave our back four lots of protection. I thought Sitayitayi as well as Mbesuma were quiet the entire game so our two central defenders have done a very good job. Overall I m very very pleased. Arrows travel to Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Wednesday to take on reigning African champions Mamelodi Sundowns before going back home to welcome Polokwane City on November 30. - TMG Sport
