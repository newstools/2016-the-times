Cosatu also dismissed criticism of Ramaphosa for his role in the Marikana massacre, saying this had been a ploy to discredit the ANC-led government, not necessarily the ANC deputy president himself. The federation announced its support for Ramaphosa after its central executive committee meeting this week. You keep raising Marikana when the commission put in place found Cyril not guilty. Things will be raised, it doesn t matter who leads the ANC, this war is not against individuals, but against the ANC. [Opposition parties] are after regime change, said Cosatu s second deputy president, Zingiswa Losi.Prior to the committee meeting, Cosatu said it would allow affiliated unions to decide who should be endorsed as Zuma s replacement.But indications are that the labour federation had buckled under pressure from affiliates such as the National Union of Mineworkers, National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union, South African Democratic Teachers Union and Communication Workers Union, which recently expressed public support for Ramaphosa.The ANC will hold its elective conference in December next year and factions within the party and aligned structures are intensifying lobbying for preferred candidates.Co s atu s first deputy president, Tyotyo James, said it should be remembered that it was Ramaphosa who liberated workers during apartheid s dark days. We should not forget that Cyril Ramaphosa founded the National Union of Mineworkers and was founding general secretary.Through his actions mineworkers were liberated from the prison-like conditions in the mines, he said.Cosatu s decision to support Ramaphosa is widely seen as a slap in the face for its president, Sdumo Dlamini, a staunch Zuma supporter who wanted the federation to support a candidate aligned to Zuma.In another announcement indicating its impatience with Zuma, Cosatu said it supported the institution of a judicial commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture as recommended by former public protector Thuli Madonsela.
