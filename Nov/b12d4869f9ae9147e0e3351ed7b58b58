It's a part of Test cricket - getting out there and winning that moment for your team. It's going to be fun."Fun? Maybe if you're in no danger of having to pad up and face that kind of music.As one of Australia's senior batsmen, David Warner is not so lucky.At least Australia's vice-captain is not the snake that Dale Steyn wants to behead - as the colourful fast bowler said on Sunday about home side captain Steve Smith."There are 11 players in the team and if Dale wants to start playing that game I'll let him do that," Warner said yesterday."For us it's about going out and doing our best, and if he feels that cutting the head off the snake [will make] everyone else fall apart, I don't see that happening at all."That's fast bowler talk."We know the conditions we're going to face out here.
