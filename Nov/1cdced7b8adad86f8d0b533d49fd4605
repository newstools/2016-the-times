Ahead of his Blade Runner sequel, Villeneuve has taken his first step into sci-fi with Arrival - a smart, controlled, thoughtful and human-centred examination of what might happen if humans were to encounter alien life.More in the vein of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Contact than the fireball-engulfed action of Independence Day, the story begins with the arrival in several countries of alien ships shaped like large pebbles which suspend themselves waiting for something no one is sure of.Tragic and lonely linguistics professor Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is enlisted by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to be part of a top secret team of scientists which includes mathematics genius Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) in an effort to communicate with the aliens.Beautifully shot in de-saturated hues by Bradford Young, Villeneuve's film aims for plausibility in its depiction of the encounters. There's a haunting atmosphere that hangs over what starts off as a mystery and then morphs slowly into an examination of grief and loss and love.There's also political drama as the world teeters on the brink of war which can only be avoided if Banks and the team come up with a way to understand the visitors before time runs out.Without resorting to the sentimentalism of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar or the intricate physics headaches of Primer, Villeneuve delivers a provocative piece of science fiction that, in an age when everything seems upside down, asks viewers to keep their eyes on the bigger picture.Central to a plot - based on a short story by Ted Chiang - that sometimes threatens to veer into absurdity, is the strength of Amy Adams's performance. She manages to convey the complex emotional balancing act between wonder, rationalism and regret that Banks must constantly negotiate in an effort to unlock the secrets offered by these interplanetary tourists.Belief in Adams allows you to forgive some of the sketchiness around the details of how exactly Banks and Donnelly manage to figure out how to speak "alien".There's also a twisty ending that sparks a retrospective revaluation of what we've been watching and what it might all mean.In the end the question is whether we can ever really understand anyone else, no matter how sophisticated the tools at our disposal.
