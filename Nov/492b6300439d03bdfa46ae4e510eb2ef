After a bright start Malesela s exciting Chippa have slipped in form and have not won in three matches to drop to eighth place in the Premier Soccer League.Malesela was not pleased with his side s 1-1 draw against Platinum Stars at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Friday night where Thembinkosi Lorch gave his side a 27th minute lead but Robert Ng ambi equalised in the 61st. It was not a good display by ourselves at home."We made a lot of errors in passing the ball and basic defending mistakes that could have cost us the entire three points Malesela said. We didn t look hungry enough for the three points and did not look like a team playing at home. Chippa meet Gavin Hunt s Wits whose impressive start to the season sees them the only side still unbeaten in league and cup matches.Crowned MTN8 champions with their 3-0 deconstruction of Mamelodi Sundowns in the final Wits can go top of the PSL by beating Chippa.The Clever Boys currently have four wins and a draw from five matches and continued their convincing form with a 2-1 away win against Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday.Malesela said his side will aim for maximum points from a match that will pit Chippa s on-the-carpet quick-passing style against Wits excellent organisational structure and aggressive style of play. Our target was to get at least seven points out of these current three games."Now we have two points out of two games. Against Wits we will try and attack to get three points which will leave us with five points from the three games. We will have to change a number of personnel we must and unfortunately when things are not going well you constantly find yourself reshuffling the starting XI. Wits have moved their home match to Dobsonville Stadium as a precautionary measure due to the Fees Must Fall movement s protest on the Wits University campus.The Clever Boys had to abandon their match at Bidvest Stadium against Orlando Pirates on September 24 due to the possibility of disruptions. - TMG Digital
