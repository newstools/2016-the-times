Malema made this comment on Monday after he appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate s Court on charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 for for calling on people to occupy vacant land around the country. The Democratic Alliance said Malema s violent and threatening language had no place in our constitutional democracy. Indeed the Constitution is founded on the democratic principles of human dignity equality and freedom and the fact the South Africa belong to all those who live in it DA national spokesman Phumzile van Damme said in a statement. The FF Plus said that by encouraging people to occupy land illegally Malema was making himself as guilty as those who contravene the laws of the country. Malema s comment today which reads: we are not calling for the slaughtering of whites at least not for now is hate speech and with this Malema says that a time will come that he will be asking black people to murder white people FF Plus chairman Pieter Groenewald said in a statement. Groenewald said this was racial hatred and created the potential for civil war in South Africa. Malema and the EFF should take note that white landowners will not just meekly sit and watch how their land is occupied and taken away. - TMG Digital
