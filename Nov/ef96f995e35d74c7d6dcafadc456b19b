It is yet another blight on the authority's tarnished reputation.The NPA is already in a state of turmoil.Abrahams' deputy, Nomgcobo Jiba, and her colleague, Lawrence Mrwebi, head of the NPA's special crimes unit, are facing suspension after the Pretoria High Court ordered that they be struck from the roll of advocates. They are appealing the decision.They have been placed on special leave and have to give Zuma reasons why they should not be suspended.Judge Francis Legodi found that Jiba and Mrwebi were "not fit and proper" for their jobs following their decision to drop charges against former crime intelligence head Richard Mdluli, who faced a number of indictments, including embezzlement from a secret slush fund.We should all be extremely concerned.The role of the NPA is to institute and conduct criminal proceedings on behalf of the state and, in a country with such a high incidence of crime, much of it sickeningly violent, the importance of this function cannot be over-estimated.Criminals should fear the prosecuting authority.But when its top leadership is embroiled in controversy, facing allegations that they are abusing their positions to fight political battles, and needing to show why they are fit and proper to hold office, criminals have a lot less to fear and ordinary South Africans come off second-best.Our policing and investigation can be world-class (but not always) and our judicial system is fair and independent (it has repeatedly demonstrated this) but if the body that bridges these two arms of the state is rotten, the wheels of justice will grind to a halt.It's time to fix the NPA once and for all.
