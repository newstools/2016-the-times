The Sunday Times wrote that the investigating unit is investigating the three for failing to report Jonas's sensational claim that one of the Gupta brothers Ajay offered him a R600-million bribe and the finance minister post. We are not investigating any of them. The person the Sunday Times spoke to must tell the country what he is talking about Hawks spokesperson Hangwana Mulaudzi said.The Sunday newspaper quoted Mulaudzi confirming that the three are being probed and that the Hawks were waiting for the National Prosecuting Authority to advise on how to proceed with the matter. This is called politicking. We are not aware of any investigation. The Sunday Times said they heard from someone of high authority that the minister [Jonas] is being investigated. TMG Digital
