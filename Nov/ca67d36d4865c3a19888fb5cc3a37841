A year since five young eland were released at Rondevlei Nature Reserve in Grassy Park, near Cape Town, scientists studying their grazing habits say big strides have been made.Now there are plans to introduce eland to the Blaauwberg Nature Reserve to curtail invasive acacias.Many of the 1000 species in the Cape Flats sand fynbos biome have been pushed to the brink of extinction by urbanisation and alien vegetation."The eland will eat the bush thickets so that the mosaic of the Cape Flats dune strandveld forms again," said project manager Petru Botha.They also have a healthy appetite for alien vegetation, such as Port Jackson."With the opening of the bush, new plants will be able to grow, so the diversity will increase and hopefully the bird species will come back," said Botha.One of the founders of the eland project, Dalton Gibb, from the City of Cape Town biodiversity management branch, said the Rondevlei eland may soon move to other nature reserves.The project has created jobs and is developing skills. "Two of the [eland] monitors are already on an NQF level 4 development programme. We have [students] doing their internship year and there are many volunteers here," said Botha.
