Paramedics tried in vain to resuscitate the child by performing CPR for 30 minutes. ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene and found provincial services performing CPR on the child who was found lying in the yard of the residence said a statement by ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring. Unfortunately after 30 minutes of CPR no vital signs returned and he was pronounced dead on the scene. It is believed that the child had been playing with some exposed wires when he was electrocuted.
