It was never going to succeed because the ANC always pulls together when it is facing an external assault such as that mounted by the DA's Mmusi Maimane.But this time around Maimane was able to make his point in a very different way.He produced a series of quotes from ANC members sitting on the benches to his right, which strongly suggested that there were many within the party who want Zuma gone.He called out the party's former chief whip, Mathole Motshekga, quoting him as saying: "The ANC leadership must choose between the president on the one hand, and the ANC and the people of South Africa, on the other hand."Then he quoted the current whip, Jackson Mthembu, who said: "Why should the NEC not step down, given that we have messed up? All these things happened under our watch."He quoted Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom, who said: "Enough is enough. Clean-up time. We love our country."Then he quoted the deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, who said: "We want leadership that is committed to the people of our country, leadership that will not be found wanting in any respect whatsoever."He quoted Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi as saying: "It's not because it's Pravin, but because I don't believe this should happen to anybody."And he quoted the ANC's Thulas Nxesi, who said: "We must deal with corruption, whether it's by a politician or public servant."Maimane finished off by saying: "It is not often that so many of us agree with each other. Today we have a chance to make this agreement work for our country."He lost the vote - but he made his point. The rebellion against Zuma is no longer an opposition affair. It extends to deep within the ruling party.
