Speaking on Good Morning America recently, the singer claimed that her heart is "hanging in there" after breaking it off with her former beau."My heart is OK, I'm hanging in there," Mary revealed."I mean, no one wants to go through this and this is hard. I'm hanging in there."Mary and Martin decided to go their separate ways after 12 years of marriage."The breaking point was when I kept asking over and over and over again for respect and to be respected," she continued."And it just seemed like I was beating a dead horse and it seemed like I was talking to a wall. I just wasn't getting it back so if I can't get respect in the relationship, then I have to move on and save myself. That was the point where I was like, 'I'm done. I just can't do it anymore.'"Martin is asking for more than R1 million ($129,000) a month in spousal support from the singer, which will fund his private chef, personal trainer and holidays. They have no children together."My message to those women that are going through the same thing that I'm going through or a similar situation is that you cannot rely on people to handle your business.You have to handle your business. You have to take responsibility and stay on top of it because things like this will happen if you don't," she said.Well known for writing through heartbreak in her music, Mary explained that being on tour has been cathartic for her."It's been so healthy for me because this is where I bring all my pain. I bring it to the stage ... and my fans are there. They come to the show with all of their issues or trials and tribulations and this is where we're healing. I have to stay strong and I have to be the strength for myself. I had to save myself and I'm saving myself now."
