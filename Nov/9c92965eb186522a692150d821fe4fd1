Chikane likened the ANC leaders in the national executive committee to prisoners whose movement and voices are stifled."Why the Nkandla issue went as far as it went it is because our leaders are... captive... like in prison. They know what is right but they cannot do it. Like a person going through a nightmare you cannot run scream.""We want the leaders of the ANC and members to be liberated."Chikane said he found it odd that when an ANC branch region and province is dysfunctional it gets disbanded and a task team gets appointed to oversee the rebuilding of those structures.He said the objective of the consultative conference would be to rebuild and renew the ANC like the party did at its Morogoro conference where the party rejuvenated itself.- TMG Digital
