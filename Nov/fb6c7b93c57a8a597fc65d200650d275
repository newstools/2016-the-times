The trio were paid by a woman who was arrested with her husband on a charge of possession of stolen property in exchange for their freedom in Cape Town. After paying the money the person was released and went to court the next day to make enquiries why her husband was not released only to learn that the charge against her was never dropped said police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Andr Traut.The surprised woman had to appear in court along with her husband. Shortly afterwards she reported the three to the police in Khayelitsha.Two sergeants aged 40 and 38 and a 50-year-old clerk were promptly arrested by the Western Cape Anti-Corruption unit. They will appear soon at the Khayelitsha Magistrate s Court. Corruption within our ranks will not be tolerated and we will not hesitate to take action against our members who have no respect for the law said Traut.
