Cassper Nyovest and Tanzania's Diamond Platnumz team up for a killer Coke Studio fusion that promises not to disappoint.TshisaLIVE was there for some of the fusion and watched as the pair worked hard in studio on their track.Cassper and Diamond hit it off immediately and, with loads of energy, quickly threw themselves into the task of constructing a track.Cassper constantly bounced between the recording booth and production desk. At one point, he even danced in the hallways between the two, as their song blasted through the speakers. Diamond added his unique flavour to the song, while young production wizard Gemini Major worked his magic on production.The result was an explosion of sound that is so catchy it could even get a stone to dance.We caught up with Diamond after the session to get his thoughts on the fusion. He described the collaboration with Cassper as a dream come true and said he couldn't wait for fans to witness the fusion. But that's not the only fusion that fans can look forward to seeing this week.Coke Studio has introduced us to some of the brightest up-and-coming acts in the country, and this week showcases the talent of Durban funk-rock band Nje and Limpopo hip-hop artist SpaceMunna.As you can guess, it's an interesting mix of sounds that after some navigating, makes for a fascinating fusion.Their goal is simple: make a feel good song that will bring joy to the nation.Unfortunately, Nje's Portia soon finds herself struggling to find the right notes in the recording booth.Will she be able to get it right?You'll just have to tune in and see for yourself.Coke Studio airs on Saturdays, e.tv, 6:05pm.This content was produced by the TshisaLIVE team in partnership with Coca-Cola.
