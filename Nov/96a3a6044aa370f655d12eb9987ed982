Banyana Banyana beat Egypt 5-0 in Limbe in their final group match on Friday to book their place in the semis after failing to score in the opening two Group A matches - a 0-0 draw against Zimbabwe and 1-0 defeat to Cameroon.The physically-imposing Nigerians have scored a mammoth 11 goals in their three group matches so far. They walloped Mali 6-0 in their first match and were contained by Ghana who held them to a 1-1 draw.The Super Falcons found their scoring touch again in a 4-0 mauling of Kenya on Saturday to advance to the semifinals as winners of Group B.The meeting at the Stade Limbe Omnisport will be the fourth time that the Super Falcons face Banyana in the semifinals of this tournament.Nigeria who have won this tournament a record nine times have twice denied Banyana passage to the final.They thrashed Banyana 5-0 in the semifinal of the 2002 edition.Banyana only defeated the West Africans once in the semis - at the 2012 tournament in Equatorial Guinea.The Falcons avenged their 2012 loss to South Africa with a 2-1 semifinal win at the 2014 tournament in Namibia.Despite the dismal record against Nigeria Banyana interim coach Desiree Ellis is confident her team can change their fortunes against their nemesis. We have a worthy opponent the defending champions who have a better history than us in the tournament and in our meetings we have to respect that no two ways about it said Ellis ahead of the match. But when we get onto the pitch it s XI v XI and if we get the tactics right we could just come out victorious. Banyana will be without striker Jermaine Seoposenwe who is serving a suspension after collecting two yellow cards. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
