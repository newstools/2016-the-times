At 4.30am South Africa time today Steyn would have been halfway home to have his broken shoulder surgically repaired. Rabada would have been marking out a run-up, ready to let fly to add to his haul of 3/49 in search of the six wickets South Africa still need to go to Hobart with a series lead."Dale Steyn is a massive loss to South Africa but 'KG' (Rabada) has done it before and he did it again," South African bowling coach Charl Langeveldt said.Australia would have been trying to get their minds right to resume on 169/4, chasing the 539 they need to win.Usman Khawaja stood admirably firm for his 58 not out. But his reliable support had dwindled to Mitchell Marsh, who was 15 not out, with Peter Nevill to come.In Steyn's absence Rabada has the canny, experienced Vernon Philander in his corner as well as debutant left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj. For the rest, step up Stephen Cook, who sent down two overs of military medium pace yesterday, and JP Duminy, who got through eight overs of off-spin. Dean Elgar could get a bowl today, as might Temba Bavuma.But the buck will stop with Rabada - who is still only 21 and playing in just his ninth Test. Rabada took on the responsibility Steyn left him and with it he took the fight to the Aussies, dismissing Shaun Marsh, Steve Smith and Adam Voges - all to catches off the edge.But before any of that happened Bavuma stopped the world with a moment of pure magic.David Warner nudged into the covers and set off for a single, satisfied that he had put enough daylight between the ball and Bavuma, who was stationed at point.Bavuma swooped, dived and threw all in one outrageous motion to run Warner out.Coming on top of the fine 73 Philander scored in sharing stands of 116 with Quinton de Kock, who made 64, and 72 with Maharaj to take South Africa to 540/8 before the declaration came in the fourth over after lunch, Bavuma's brilliance seemed too good to be true. But then came Rabada's.
