Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga acknowledged yesterday that more could be done in achieving the minimum uniform norms and standards for infrastructure for state schools."It is unlikely that we will get R98-billion so we must prioritise and rationalise schools," she said.Giving a progress report on how the backlogs in the provision of infrastructure for schools were being tackled, Motshekga said:"Provinces such as the Free State, Limpopo and Eastern Cape remain behind with the delivery of basic services at schools," she said.But the NGO Equal Education said the minister's statements were "not far from gossip as she cannot produce any proof in the form of progress reports to back her claims".Equal Education secretary-general Tshepo Motsepe said the NGO had asked the department for reports on the delivery of schools infrastructure in each province but had received nothing."It is a lack of political will and of capacity that has brought us here: politicians and public servants planned to fail to meet the first deadline stipulated by the norms and standards for school infrastructure," Motsepe said.A report on the state of infrastructure and basic services at schools will be published at the end of this month, the department said.
