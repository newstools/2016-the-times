In a video that went viral two white man assaulted Mlotshwa and put him in a coffin. They face charges of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm.The men appeared in the Middelburg Magistrate s Court on Wednesday and their case was postponed until January 25. The dehumanising and humiliating assault on Mr Mlotshwa by two men has justifiably met with public outrage and the FW de Klerk Foundation supports action that recommits all South Africans to our founding provisions of the Constitution to value human dignity non-racialism and the rule of law the foundation said in a statement. It also commended the National Prosecuting Authority for swift action taken against the alleged perpetrators.The foundation said words and deeds intended to demean people based on race religion gender and other differences was anathema to the values and work of the foundation. We hope the justice system will reach an outcome that restores a measure of dignity to Mr Mlotshwa. - TMG Digital
