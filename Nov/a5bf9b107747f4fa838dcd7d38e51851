You see, Samkelo is tired of people always giving the compliment: "you are pretty for a dark skin girl" and she want us all to understand that we can be pretty without a disclaimer."Stop saying this thing! Stop thinking it! It's not a real thing. Liberate yourself and see that you are still enslaved if you think like this. If you still separate black people by their shade of black," she wrote in an Instagram rant this week.The Rhythm City actress went on to explain that Africa is "the factory of black people" where people of all shades and sizes live."This is Afrika, the factory of black people. Where black people are made. And we all come in different shades and sizes. I am not beautiful in spite of my skin, I'm beautiful because of it!" Samkelo wrote.This is not the first time that Samkelo has taken to the social media platform to address body shapes and complexions. In April, she preached an Insta-sermon on not letting your body define you."Your body shape and skin tone does not define you. It simply compliments the enigma you already are. Celebrate yourself " Samkelo wrote. Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
