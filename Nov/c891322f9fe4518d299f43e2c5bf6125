Malesela believes his side who remain 10th in the league standings will bounce back.He told reporters after being narrowly beaten at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium that losses were not hampering us but building us . Yes we want results but what is key for me is if people are entertained."I don t think there is anybody who left the stadium who is not happy with what he or she saw."So that is the primary thing. We have been struggling with a few things trying to find a good balance particularly in the midfield."Slowly slowly we are getting there. Obviously the players need to get to understand each other and each other s role and once they do that things will get better. We have a challenge in terms of fixing little errors at the back which are not necessary at times."It is important to be confident in your play but you must not be careless."It is simplest job you can ever get in a football match because yours is just to mark win the ball pass finish nothing else."But if you want to try other things you get messed up."But we are training these players and we are not going to get impatient."The losses are not hampering us but they are building us. Because we can always find the solutions."I already have two solutions in my head to fix mistakes we made and we ll get it right. Malesela s side have lost five and drawn two of their last seven games and last won away at Baroka FC in late September.They are away at Maritzburg United next Tuesday in their next league fixture. - TMG Digital
