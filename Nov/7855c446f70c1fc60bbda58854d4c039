Hawks spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi said a docket had been sent to the Specialised Commercial Crimes unit in Johannesburg together with a request for further instructions.A senior public prosecutor told the Hawks to obtain statements under warning."Once these have been collected the docket will be sent back to the Johannesburg specialised commercial crimes unit for a decision [on whether to prosecute]," he said.In 2009, Aurora Empowerment Systems - co-owned by President Jacob Zuma's nephew, Khulubuse Zuma, and Nelson Mandela's grandson, Zondwa Mandela - took over the Pamodzi gold mines on the East Rand, and in Orkney, in North West after the provisional liquidation of the proprietary company.The Supreme Court of Appeal in May upheld a Pretoria High Court ruling that Aurora's directors had acted recklessly and fraudulently when they took control of the mines, and should be held personally liable for damages amounting to R1.7-billion .The judgment paved the way for Aurora directors to be criminally charged for corruption and the mismanagement of the two mines.More than 5000 former Aurora workers claim that they have not been paid despite the sale of Aurora's assets to Gold One for R70-million.One worker, Terra Dimane, said he was yet to be paid a severance package and proceeds of a provident fund of about R30000.John Walker, a lawyer representing Aurora's liquidators, said they had responded to the workers' complaints."The master convened a meeting a week after the complaints were handed to him. [He] demanded that we respond, which we did."
