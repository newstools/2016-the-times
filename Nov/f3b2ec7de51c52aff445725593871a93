National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Phindi Louw on Tuesday told TMG Digital that one of the two people was arrested on Monday while another was arrested on Tuesday. I know some of them are correctional services officials. They will all [including Krejcir] be appearing in the Kempton Park Magistrate s Court tomorrow [Wednesday] Louw said.Krejcir appeared in the South Gauteng High Court on Monday along with his four co-accused in the murder case of slain Lebanese national and drug dealer Sam Issa.According to The Star security around Krejcir has been tightened following his escape plot where mercenary ex-military forces were allegedly set to be hired to break the Czech fugitive out of prison .Krejcir according to The Star has now been transferred to Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria.Krejcir s first plans to escape were thwarted by the Department of Correctional Services when it conducted a raid in a number of cells at Zonderwater Correctional Centre last year. A number of illegal items were found in Krejcir s cell and those of other inmates he was planning the escape with.Amongst the items found in Krejcir s cell were a pistol ammunition a knife an item that looked like a Taser a pepper spray gun screwdriver steel blades 10 cellphones a memory stick and a diary which contained the names of witnesses and investigators in his cases.Krejcir has offered to give evidence against senior law enforcement officials he allegedly colluded with in return for a lighter sentence.Louw would not be drawn on this offer. As the NPA we are not commenting on that she said. TMG Digital
