On the issue of the finance minister I've addressed it earlier on. I think its only proper for me to respond to issues around the matter tomorrow [Friday] before the portfolio committee of justice and correctional services said Abrahams. Do I intend stepping down? I have not considered it yet. But I will always do what is right. That is the oath that I ve taken since the commencement of my career. I will always do what is right said Abrahams.On whether he will apologise to Gordhan Abrahams said he didn t think it was necessary for him to answer that question. That s something I expect committee to ask me said Abrahams.Abrahams is expected to face the heat from MPs on Friday regarding his decision to charge Gordhan only to withdraw them just weeks later.- TMG Digital/The Times
