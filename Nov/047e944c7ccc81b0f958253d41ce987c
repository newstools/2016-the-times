 Our target for this season is the league. Playing in the Telkom Knockout semifinal was just a gift said coach Giovanni Solinas as the club prepared to host Platinum Stars at home at Goble Park in Bethlehem in the Absa Premiership on Wednesday. We now have to get back into the fight in the league and put all our energy into getting points. Stars sit bottom of the standings without a win having drawn five and lost five of their 10 matches. At home they have three draws and two defeats.Stars have played their last four matches on the road and last week travelled from Limpopo Province down to the Mother City with little time to rest between the league game at Polokwane City and the cup clash with Cape Town City. We needed energy to fight against City but we didn t have any. We didn t recover we tried to play football we tried to win but we were too tired in the end Solinas said. It has been really difficult to play four away games in a row. We just didn t have the right time to recover and to prepare. We have to accept that is what it is but now we can look at the league. After the Battle of the Stars the team from Bethlehem are away at Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
