The court came to this conclusion as it set aside a decision of the bargaining council which held last year that the dismissal of Margarethie Bredenkamp was substantively and procedurally unfair and ordered her reinstatement.Bredenkamp was found guilty of misconduct in relation to an incident at the printer/photocopier room at the Treasury in March 2012 where she had an altercation with her subordinate Ashani Singh.Bredenkamp also deliberately tripped Singh as she was leaving the printer room after their colleagues had intervened.Singh also claimed Bredenkamp used a word which is deemed to be a derogatory reference to people of Indian origin.Bredenkamp was dismissed in March 2013.Bredenkamp referred her dismissal to the bargaining council which held that despite the seriousness of the assault dismissal was inappropriate.Unhappy with the decision the minister of finance asked the Labour Court to review the arbitrator s decision.In a judgment passed this month Labour Court Judge David Gush said the arbitrator s finding that the deliberate assault on Singh did not warrant dismissal was not a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence placed before him.Gush said there was no doubt that the evidence adduced at the arbitration established clearly that Bredenkamp after her altercation with Singh tripped Singh as she was leaving the printer/photocopier room after their colleagues had intervened.He said the arbitrator correctly concluded that this should be regarded as serious misconduct.Gush said the arbitrator however concluded that despite the seriousness of the assault dismissal was inappropriate. What the (arbitrator) ignored was that the deliberate tripping took place after the intervention of the colleagues and the break-up of the altercation. That (Bredenkamp) saw fit after the break-up of the incident and in the presence of her colleagues to then deliberately trip Ms Singh exacerbates the seriousness of her misconduct Gush said.However Gush said the minister had not complied with the disciplinary procedures and that the procedure was in fact unfair.Gush found that the dismissal was fair but procedurally unfair and ordered the minister to pay Bredenkamp an amount equivalent to six months salary as compensation for procedural unfairness. - TMG Digital
