Samuel, like many other people, clearly didn't believe that a Trump presidency was a strong option.But Trump has been victorious and has been elected the next president by the people of America.During a comedy sketch on Jimmy Kimmel Live in December, Samuel was very vocal about Trump. If that motherf*cker becomes president I will move my black ass to South Africa. The sketch was titled The Hateful Eight Ball with Samuel L. Jackson and was referring to the new movie by Quentin Tarantino.
