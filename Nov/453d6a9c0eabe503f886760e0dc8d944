The last result between the two teams was SuperSport s dramatic record-equalling 6-1 thrashing of Pirates at the same venue in a Premier League match on November 1.Before that SuperSport also beaten the Buccaneers 3-2 in May s season-ending 2015-16 Nedbank Cup final.While those results might give SuperSport some psychological edge ahead of the Telkom semifinal Baxter is also clearly wary of a backlash from wounded Pirates. Every athlete is also a human being so somewhere in your consciousness there s a thought of that."But you can t allow that to take any room Baxter said of how SuperSport have approached the semifinal in the context of their last result against Bucs. Because the reality is that Orlando Pirates in any game in any tournament is one of the toughest games you can have in this country. So that s the reality. And we would have to be some sort of big-time Charlies to think that because we ve won one game we can knock over all the best teams in the country without raising a gallop. Now I don t think that s anything that I will allow the players to be thinking about. And I don t think the players are the type of group that become too complacent too easily. So I ve not had to do a lot of work on it. But what we have done is we ve spoken about it in the training sessions."Not just from that game but because we don t want any complacency growing within the group or a satisfaction that That 2-1 was OK and now we want a 4-1 . We want people to be hungry."So I think rather than talk about that game and not being complacent we ve tried to put that to one side and talk about not being satisfied and being hungry and wanting more. SuperSport go into the semifinal unbeaten in 11 league and cup matches though have drawn their last two games 1-1 against Baroka FC then by the same scoreline against Kaizer Chiefs.Pirates have won three games in a row since Augusto Palacios replaced Muhsin Ertugral as coach. - TMG Digital
