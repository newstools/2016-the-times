It was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's first statement since Iraqi forces launched a massive offensive on October 17 to retake Mosul, where the IS chief declared the group's "caliphate" two years ago."Do not retreat," Baghdadi said in a purported message released by an IS-affiliated outlet. "Holding your ground with honour is a thousand times easier than retreating in shame."In June 2014, days after jihadist fighters swept across swathes of Iraq, he made a rare public appearance in Mosul and announced the creation of an Islamic "state" straddling Iraq and Syria.The "caliphate" has been shrinking steadily since last year and Iraqi forces this week reached the outskirts of Mosul, the jihadists' last major stronghold in Iraq.If authentic, the recording would be Baghdadi's first since December 2015 and a rare sign of life.Rumours have swirled about the Iraqi jihadist leader's health and movements, and his whereabouts are unknown.He was said to have been paralysed in an air strike on Mosul in March 2015."To all the people of Nineveh, especially the fighters, beware of any weakness in facing your enemy," the message exhorted.He called on IS supporters to fight the "enemies of God" and for the suicide fighters to "turn the nights of the unbelievers into days, to wreak havoc in their land and make their blood flow as rivers".IS has fallen back when massively outnumbered in recent battles, giving up some of its emblematic bastions - such as Fallujah in Iraq and Dabiq in Syria - without following its own apocalyptic ideology of fighting to the bitter end.In the message, which is undated but makes reference to events that are at most a few weeks old, Baghdadi also calls for attacks against Saudi Arabia - a favourite target - and Turkey.Ankara has troops stationed at a base just outside Mosul and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's rhetoric has raised fears of an expanded Turkish military intervention in Iraq.Baghdadi said that his followers who could not travel to Syria or Iraq should aim for Libya,He attempted to stir up sectarian resentment by referring to religious flags and slogans of Shia fighters among Iraqi forces, and by accusing other Sunni groups and politicians of treason.The recapture of Mosul by Iraqi forces could spell the end of the group's days as a land-holding force in Iraq and deal a death blow to the "caliphate".The US-led coalition supporting the Iraqi offensive estimates that the number of IS fighters holed up in Mosul is 3000 to 5000.Iraqi forces, advancing on Mosul from three main fronts, have retaken dozens of villages and towns scattered over hundreds of square kilometres.This week, federal forces reached the eastern edge of Mosul and on Wednesday were clearing the most recently reconquered areas.A reporter in Gogjali, on the eastern frontline, saw larger than usual numbers of civilians walking to safer areas with little or no belongings."Some of the kids that arrive are barefoot, and they don't have sufficient water and food," said Alvhild Stromme, a media adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council."People who come out, as they have for the last two weeks, are still telling stories of very dangerous escapes."People who escaped IS rule have recounted tales of jihadist brutality."We're coming from the world of the dead back to the world of the living," said Raed Ali, 40, who fled his home in the nearby village of Bazwaya."It was raining bombs. One landed on our house. Fortunately my children are safe now.""I lost two years of my life," said another man, who gave his name as Fares. "I sent my family to safety in [the Iraqi Kurdish capital] Arbil two years ago but I stayed behind in our house in Bazwaya. I'm finally out today. I will see my family again."With an assault on Mosul looking imminent, aid groups said they were "bracing for the worst". A million-plus civilians are still believed trapped in the city.Thousands are being used by IS as human shields, according to the UN .
