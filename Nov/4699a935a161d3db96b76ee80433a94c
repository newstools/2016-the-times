This comes two days after the party s leader Mmusi Maimane laid corruption charges against President Jacob Zuma on the basis of former public protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report which made a number of observations about the relationship between the president and the Gupta family.The DA s Natasha Mazzone said the charges against Molefe will be under the Public Finance Management Act; Prevention Combating of Corrupt Activities Act; and the Powers Privileges and Immunities of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act . We cannot stand by as those in positions of power are allowed to abuse state institutions for their own selfish gain and to the detriment of South Africans she said in a statement. It is now time that he is brought to book and these charges are a step towards ensuring that this happens. Molefe recently resigned from Eskom in the interests of good corporate governance but said his resignation was not an admission of wrongdoing on his part.He had at an earlier Eskom briefing become emotional and appeared to break down in tears while trying to explain his movements in Saxonwold the Johannesburg suburb where the Gupta family resides.On Wednesday BusinessLIVE reported that Mark Pamensky the Eskom director most directly linked to the Gupta family had resigned from the board.Pamensky who is also a director of telecoms company Blue Label as well as of the Gupta-owned Oakbay Resources was among those subpoenaed by Madonsela for her report.The allegations in that report are sufficiently serious to make it impossible for Molefe and the Eskom board to continue with business as usual and they must stand down Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim said.
