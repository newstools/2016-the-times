This is revealed in the transcript of the interview, at which Zuma was represented by Hulley and Bonisiwe Makhene, an advocate in the Presidency.According to the transcript released yesterday, Hulley fired the first salvo."Well, maybe we should just cut to the chase and find out why there is a rush [to complete the state capture report]," Hulley said.The then public protector retorted: "I'm rushing it because I am supposed to have finished this matter within 30 days. I'm rushing it because I have institutional memory relatingto this case."Madonsela later asked whether Zuma intended to continue with the interview.Hulley interjected, prompting this reply from Madonsela: "Please ... can you stop talking for the president? Mr Hulley, I'm forbidding you from speaking. I'm asking Mr President to address me."
