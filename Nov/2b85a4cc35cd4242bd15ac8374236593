CPI data for October is due for release on Wednesday followed by producer price inflation data (PPI) for the same month on Thursday. | CPI inflation is forecast to have risen by 6.0% year on year (y/y in October versus a prior 6.1% y/y and is expected to average 6.0% y/y in the fourth quarter says Kaplan. In October food and petrol price dynamics are likely to have remained the key influencing factor on the headline CPI outcome. Specifically the food and petrol price components should reflect the continued lagged drought effects as well as the petrol price hike of 43c/litre in the month of October she says. PPI inflation is forecast to have decelerated to 5.9% y/y in October from 6.6% y/y in September Kaplan adds. Advance indications provided by the manufacturing PMI survey suggest the easing in producer price pressures during the third quarter of 2016 persisted into the fourth quarter she says adding that rand appreciation has been a contributing factor. The moderation in PPI inflation and the SARB s projection of CPI inflation returning to the target range in 2017 provides some room for the SARB to keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming November MPC meeting. Specifically the SARB forecasts inflation to average 6.4% in 2016 and 5.8% in 2017. The SARB has noted that should these forecasts transpire it may be close to the end of the tightening cycle notes Kaplan.Also due for release this week is the leading economic indicator for September.
