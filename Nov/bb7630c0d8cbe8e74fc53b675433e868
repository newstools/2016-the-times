Madonsela's outgoing report into undue political influence by the Gupta family said remedial action had to be taken. This included placing the onus on President Jacob Zuma to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry headed by a judge selected by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng within 30 days. The country s new Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has to ensure that this is done. Madonsela told Eyewitness News on Wednesday that should the remedial action she called for "not be enforced by the (new) Public Protector that won t be a train smash".

The remedial action action "will definitely move forward with civil society driving the process " she added.
