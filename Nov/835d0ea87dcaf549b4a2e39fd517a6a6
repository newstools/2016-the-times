 According to the reply two societies representing musicians SA Music Performance Rights Association (SAMPRA) and Independent Music Performance Rights Association (IMPRA) have been owed this amount since 2014 by the SABC's radio division said DA spokesperson on communications Phumzile Van Damme.She said this flew in the face of Motsoeneng s constant pontificating claims to support South Africa s local musicians. His 90% local content policy has now been revealed to be nothing more than an attempt to gain the public support of South Africa's musicians during his legal woes as it is not backed by a real commitment to provide the financial backing in royalty payments. The DA will be following up this matter. We will submit further parliamentary questions to find out when the outstanding monies will be paid to our country's musicians Van Damme said.She added that the DA fully supported South Africa's musicians and would fight to ensure that the SABC paid back the money.
