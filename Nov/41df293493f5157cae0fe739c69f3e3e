Sunderland's manager was serving a one-match touchline ban and must have feared the worst after 10 minutes when Dan Gosling put Bournemouth ahead off his midrift after Sunderland failed to deal with Adam Smith's cross.Only a series of saves from keeper Jordan Pickford saved Sunderland further embarrassment but they refused to buckle and equalised before the break when Victor Anichebe rocketed a shot past keeper Artur Boruc for his first goal for more than a year.Even the dismissal of Steven Pienaar, who received his second yellow card for a lunge on Junior Stanislas, did not stop the visitors, whose stunning comeback was completed with a 73rd-minute Jermain Defoe penalty after Anichebe was brought down.
