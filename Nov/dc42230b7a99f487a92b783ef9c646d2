This is after at least seven gunmen posing as paramedics gained access to the home and assaulted the boys and a security guard on Wednesday evening. The guard and three teenage boys were then kidnapped.They were later released but not before being interrogated by their kidnappers. "It seems to be that their motive was robbery but then they were more after information about the operation of the facility. When they held the boys they asked them individually for information regarding our security setup who has guns and all those questions " said managing director Pippa Jarvis. "One guard was badly beaten and was stripped naked. He was sent for counselling. The robbers also took two cell phones which belonged to the boys as well as all their shoes " added Jarvis. The home was also targeted last Friday. Wednesday's incident is the second this month and fourth this year according to Jarvis. - TMG Digital
