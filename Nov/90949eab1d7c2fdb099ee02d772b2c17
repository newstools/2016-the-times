The state's criminal case against Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride crashed yesterday before it even got off the ground.Sandile July, of Werksman Attorneys, yesterday told prosecutors he would not testify about a report that he drafted."One of the witnesses, who was responsible for drafting the report that Police Minister Nathi Nhleko relied on to suspend McBride and his co-accused, would not testify in court under oath as he said his own report was hearsay," said Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini, who was in court yesterday. The report was used by Nhleko to suspend McBride.The withdrawal comes 24 hours after National Director of Public Prosecutions head Shaun Abrahams announced that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two former SARS executives Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay would not be prosecuted for fraud and theft.McBride, Ipid 's former Limpopo head Innocent Khuba and former director of investigations Matthew Sesoko were charged with defeating the ends of justice and fraud.Their charges related to their alleged altering of a report exonerating former Hawks head Anwa Dramat for his role in the rendition of Zimbabwean political dissidents back to their country in 2010. Some of those sent back to Zimbabwe were later found murdered.In his request for a postponement yesterday, prosecutor Sello Maema told the court he was hamstrung without witnesses."I need to consult," he said.McBride's advocate Mike Hellens SC told the court the state was using multifaceted excuses to steal trial time."I have never heard of state taking advice from witnesses as to the admissibility of their own evidence and then going to the [law] library to check on what the witness advised them."It's a case of the tail wagging the dog. This entire matter is an exercise in futility." A postponement was granted.When Maema returned after consultations, he told the court that "it has become apparent that a prosecution will no longer be viable"."We withdraw all charges."Questioned about the withdrawal of charges, NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaka said after consultations with the witness the prosecution team realised it would not be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt."When you make decisions to prosecute you rely on statements taken by police. So when witnesses turn, you cannot proceed. This is all that we are prepared to say," Mfaka said.Dlamini said McBride believed the case was brought against him as part of an attempt to weaken the Ipid ."This was always an attack on Ipid's independence," Dlamini said.Professor James Grant of Wits University law school said: "Apparently the NPA is starting to pay attention."The big thing now is if it is going to do the right thing with No1 (President Jacob Zuma) and his corruption case," Grant said.
