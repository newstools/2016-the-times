The score is very much a true reflection of the match because with all due respect to the North Africans this was a walk in the park for Banyana.Coming into this clash Banyana had failed to score in their matches against Zimbabwe (0-0) and Cameroon (0-1 loss) and as much as they also struggled upfront against Egypt this match was always going to go one way.Head coach Desiree Ellis made a couple of changes from the clash against Cameroon which saw attacking midfielder Silindile Ngubane and defender Noko Matlou coming in for Thembi Kgatlana and Linda Mothlalo.It was clear from the first whistle that this was a different side compared to the one that played Zimbabwe and Cameroon in Yaound .And even though Limbe is a bit warmer than the capital and Banyana had arrived just a day before they quickly settled in and attacked Egypt with ease.The disappointing part of course was the same old-fashioned failure to score goals. And the culprits? Jermaine Seoposenwe and Andisiwe Mgcoyi.Mgcoyi however made amends when she netted in the 27th minute with the easiest of finishes to give Banyana the 1-0 lead.On the other end of the field Banyana goalkeeper Andile Dlamini was reduced to a spectator and spent most of the half moving in and out of her box.So it was really no surprise that Banyana were still in the lead by the break.After the restart Banyana appeared to struggle to create any more scoring opportunities but that changed on the hour mark when defender Nothando Vilakazi added a second.Barely a minute later substitute Refiloe Jane also added her name to the scoresheet with a tap in from close range.Banyana weren t done and Seoposenwe was soon leading the celebrations as she hit the target with her left foot in the 68th minute.There was still time for substitute Linda Motlhalo to get the fifth after she dribbled some tired looking Egyptian defenders.Job done.So where to next for Banyana?The SA women s senior national team will remain in Limbe and look set for a bruising battle with Nigeria on Tuesday (8pm SA time).The problem with facing the Super Falcons who look set to win Group A is that:1) They are the defending champions2) They have dominated Banyana over the years.SA and Nigeria s senior women have met on 21 occasions with Nigeria winning 14 compared to three wins for SA while there have been four draws.Well nothing is impossible as they say and Banyana will be feeling a bit confident.Let s wait and see. - TMG Digital
