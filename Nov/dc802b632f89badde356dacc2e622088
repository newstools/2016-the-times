The Mamelodi Sundowns player s latest milestone in his career comes in the form of a late Bafana Bafana call-up for Saturday s potentially make or break 2018 World Cup qualifier at Peter Mokaba Stadium which coincides with a symbolic return to the place where his career started in Polokwane.Mamelodi Sundowns central midfielder has been called up as a replacement for the injured Dean Furman.Mabunda was a bit-part player at his club before injuries notably to Bongani Zungu and his own impressive form saw him nail down a first team place as Downs wrapped up last season s Premier Soccer League title.His form continued into an under-strength Downs progression through the Caf Champions League to being crowned African champions last month a campaign where Mabunda made his name.Mabunda should line up against superstars when Sundowns now compete in the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan in December.With his Bafana call he has the opportunity of meeting some of Senegal s stars such as forwards Mame Biram Diouf (Stoke City) Sadio Mane (Liverpool) and Diao Balde (Lazio). I m grateful for the opportunity I ve been given by the coach [Shakes Mashaba] and that he thought of me to replace Dean Furman Mabunda said after his first training session with the squad at Peter Mokaba on Thursday afternoon. He s a very influential player and a great loss for the team. I have been through many difficult situations in the past few months and learnt to rise to the occasion."Sundowns campaign in the Champions League really helped me grow as a player. It s actually a prayer I made before the season that God should place me in a position where I could compete against the best players in the world. I managed to compete against the best players on the continent with Sundowns and now I have an opportunity of competing against some of the best in the world with Diallo coming from the English Premier League. It shows that there is really growth in SA football. Mabunda s only previous call-up was for Simon Ngomane s development Amabinneplaas team that travelled to Sudan to play in the African Nations Championship in 2011 made up almost entirely of unknown players from the lower leagues.He Leopards teammate Myron Shongwe and then-Free State Stars striker Edward Manqele now at Kaizer Chiefs were among three recognisable names.Mabunda said his training session at Peter Mokaba was an emotional return to the ground where his career started. It s very emotional for me because my first PSL game was played on the very same pitch my first PSL start was played here in Polokwane and my first national team call-up comes here in Polokwane."So it s a very significant situation for me he said.
