The exciting trio will be key for the maiden appearance by the Premier Soccer League champions at the top club event in world football which starts on December 8. One thing I know and I don t care which team we are playing against when Keegan Khama and Percy are interested they ve got speed and in one-on-one situations they can cut you open '' the Sundowns coach said."It doesn t matter who you are. They will eliminate you. The difference is when Ronaldo gets the ball he finishes it."(Gareth) Bale gets the ball he buries it."(Karim) Benzema gets it he will bury it. They don t waste. But look at how many chances we miss. With the way Khama and Percy play they should be scoring a lot more."But on pure ability they can dismantle anybody. Even with five defenders Percy was running rings around Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. Up and coming Tau was given lofty praise by his coach after a man of the match performance on Saturday when Sundowns beat Chiefs 2-1 at Loftus Versfeld.Mosimane suggested Tau was now in line for a Bafana Bafana call-up. He can bring something that no one else has in that squad."I feel happy now because I feel he has his own place in the CBD added the coach in reference to the triumvirate of Leonardo Castro Billiat and Dolly which proved to be the axis of Sundowns championship success last season.Sundowns play their first match at the Club World Cup on December 11 in Osaka against the winner of a play-off match between Auckland City of New Zealand and the winner of the J-League in Japan which is now in its final play-off stages. - TMG Digital
