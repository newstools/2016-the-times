In October the organisations launched a legal challenge in the high court in Pretoria in which they seek to review and set aside the findings of the commission.The Seriti Commission report which was released by President Jacob Zuma in March found no evidence of wrongdoing or corruption in the procurement of military equipment for the South African National Defence Force in 1999.Corruption Watch and the Right2Know Campaign noted that the Constitutional Court dismissed an application brought by anti arms deal campaigner Terry Crawford Browne.They said the Constitutional Court did not make any findings on the merits of a review of the Seriti Commission but ruled that an application directly to the Constitutional Court was not in the public interest. In other words an application must be made to the High Court in the usual manner. This is what Corruption Watch and Right2Know have done. Corruption Watch and Right2Know Campaign said their case was crucial in ensuring that the truth about the arms deal scandal was not whitewashed through a flawed commission and to ensure future commissions were not compromised by similar procedural and other irregularities.Following the dismissal of his application Crawford-Browne said he would continue his fight outside the country. In anticipation that the Constitutional Court would attempt to 'duck the political hot potato' of the arms deal scandal I have already engaged a highly reputed firm of foreign lawyers who specialise in international corruption and fraud and who are looking at alternative resolutions to this saga Crawford-Browne said in a statement.
