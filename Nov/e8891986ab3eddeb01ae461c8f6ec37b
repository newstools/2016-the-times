The appointment follows the resignation of Brian Molefe earlier this month as Group Chief Executive Officer of the company. I approved the Board s request to appoint Mr Koko as acting Group Chief Executive Officer. Mr Koko has a wealth of experience and understands the challenges Eskom faces. His appointment will also ensure continuity at Eskom Brown said on Wednesday. I have also asked the Board to immediately start the process to appoint a permanent Group CEO and that this process needs their urgent attention. Mr Koko must ensure that the current trajectory at Eskom continues the minister added.
