"I think it s funny when people say this is a big physical challenge Jones told the gathered media. I said to the players If you re not physical in rugby you should be playing volleyball or curling. "Rugby is a physical game. There are two sets of teams vying for the gainline. You know if you win the gainline you re in a position to play the game well."If you don t win it you re not playing well. That s physical. So South Africa is no different from any other team. "We need to be physical every game. But the tactical part against South Africa is different."There are ways to get to South Africa and we will be smart enough to use them on Saturday. "Because of their overtness in their physicality they give you opportunities and we'll take those opportunities." The Boks have not lost to England in 12 Tests dating back a decade to November 2006 but England are on a 10-match winning streak nine of which have come under Jones coaching in 2016. The home team have seldom started as such overwhelming favourites against the Boks.Some are even comparing it to 2002 when England thrashed the Boks 53-3 at Twickenham and they ve been happy to wear the tag. It s unlikely that the scoreline will be a repeat of that 2002 debacle but it would take a supreme effort from the Springboks to overcome this England team. England captain Dylan Hartley played down the significance of it being a match against the Springboks suggesting it was just another match for the Roses. It s just the next game Hartley said. It s the next game for me and the next game for the team. It s the next game of progress as a team."So in terms of looking back no one in the team s won against South Africa and there s an opportunity for us a big carrot."But look we just want to progress we just want to get better each game and at the moment South Africa are in our way it s the next game so we re ready for that. - TMG Digital
