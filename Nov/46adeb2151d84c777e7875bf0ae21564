Instead, the students want the exams moved to January or start in two weeks' time.The students, represented by legal NGO the Socio-Economic Rights Institute, argued that the continued police presence on campus had le d to an environment not conducive to studying.Senior attorney Thulani Nkosi said the application began with 25 studentsignatories but the number had grown to 3000.Seadimo Tlale, a final-year LLB student, argued that with the continued protests and police presence, students had not had sufficient time to prepare for exams. She said if exams were held on Thursday the "inevitable" consequences would be that the vast majority of students would either fail or substantially underachieve. To avoid this, the university would have to increase the marks of all students.Tlale said black, poor students would be negatively affected."This period (#FeesMustFall protests) has been marked not only by ongoing violence but a strong police presence. Police have fired stun grenades, teargas and rubber bullets indiscriminately." Some university staff had backed the call to delay exams.The Wits Black Academics Caucus' Crispen Chinguno said students had not been able to prepare for the exams properly as they had been "traumatised" by the "militarisation of campus".Another staff member who asked to remain anonymous said the university was "setting the students up for failure."You can't possibly be studying at the barrel of a gun. I sincerely feel they shouldn't write", he said.Wits University spokesman Shirona Patel said the university was aware of the planned interdict but would not comment further.
