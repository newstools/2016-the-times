His new track, also called Famous, features Chris Brown (who was also depicted in Kanye s video).The single off Ray J's upcoming album Raydemption calls out his reality star-turned-mogul ex, with reference to their 2003 sex tape that leaked in 2007."She f****d me for fame, look in her eyes. She was the first one to sign on the line. She was the real one to plan it all out. Look at the family, they walk around proud. All because she had my d*** in her mouth," he raps.As it's clearly now Ray J's turn to piggyback off Kim's fame with this diss track, it's no coincidence the song shares a title with Kanye's Famous, which name-dropped Ray J and featured nude wax likenesses of him and Chris in its music video.Last month, Ray J told Billboard he was responding to Kanye's work with his own song with the same name."You can't fault me and Chris for responding to all the things that have been done about us [in the media] over the last few months," he said.As for Chris' involvement, his sentiments are slightly broader on the song's hook where he sings: "I know that you cry when you re going to sleep every damn night. I'll f*** around and make another one famous." Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
