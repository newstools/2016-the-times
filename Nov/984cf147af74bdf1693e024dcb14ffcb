Kelly has previously spoken about the pitfalls of fame, She has said that the intrusion into her personal life is painful as well as all the rumours that are spread about her.Here is is most recent blog post.Last night I had the honour of performing at the annual Chevrolet Feather Awards. Being on stage was magical. When I am on stage, I am content. Throughout the years in my music career, my sound was always based on what we thought people would want to hear, what we thought would sell. This time around, I took a stand and I said let me sing. I have a God-given talent. Let me use it to uplift, inspire and heal people.Through my music, I pray to touch people s hearts, even if it is just one person. I hope that I can inspire people to live their truth. Instead of all always bashing each other, name calling and bringing each other down, I would love to create a platform where we all use our experiences to inspire and through my music, I hope to do just that. You can take away all the fame, just put me on a stage and give me a microphone and I m happy. Let me sing.
