Speaking outside the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court yesterday after making a brief appearance, a defiant Dlamini said: "We have always said and maintained that we are not criminals involved in any criminal act."The student leader travelled to Bloemfontein on Monday to support E F F leader Julius Malema, who faced a charge of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act for calling on people to illegally occupy land."As you remember, yesterday I even supported my co-accused in the political ploy in Bloemfontein because I felt that our charges were politically motivated."It's clear that [our charges] were politically motivated and it's our role as young people to expose injustice anywhere." Dlamini, who is an ANC member, said he was in Bloemfontein to "support a black brother".His case was postponed yesterday to June 15. His legal team said it had applied to the High Court to have the charges against him withdrawn.On Tuesday last week, at Dlamini's bail hearing, advocates Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi argued that his arrest and prosecution were part of a political conspiracy, basing their contention on a meeting at the ANC's Luthuli House national headquarters in Johannesburg attended by the national director of public prosecutions, Shaun Abrahams, on October 10. Dlamini was arrested on October 15 at his Wits University student residence and is facing charges of public violence, theft, malicious damage to property, and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.The activist was granted R2000 bail by the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court, Alberton, on Wednesday last week.
