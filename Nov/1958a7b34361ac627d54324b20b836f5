The tournament starts on Saturday, with the national women's team facing Zimbabwe in Yaound .Though the squad will be under pressure to do better than 2014's heartbreaking fourth place in Namibia, Banyana Banyana interim coach Desiree Ellis has her own selection storm to deal with.She was at odds to explain Amanda Dlamini's absence from the squad and cited player-coach confidentiality as the reason she didn't want to comment."It's a private conversation between Amanda and I and if she wants to talk about it then she's welcome to do so."There's also the part of the player-coach privacy, but if she wants to reveal what we talked about then it's up to her," Ellis said."I understood the reasons, but I also had to look at the bigger picture and so did she, and she understood."Her experience will be missed, but I understand that we do have the squad and we have got her support."At the end of the day the door is never closed for anyone because this team doesn't belong to any individual. It belongs to the country and the players don't play for the coach, they play for the badge," the coach said.Ellis is not as bossy or dogmatic as her predecessor Vera Pauw and seems to have left the team machine untouched in terms of using star player Noko Matlou as a centreback.Matlou made her name as a striker but was converted into a defender by Pauw."That's a question you need to ask her because the first thing I asked her was where does she want to play."She's the person who needs to answer that question. I watched her playing for Ma-Indies and she's not a striker any more."She said on live radio that she's comfortable as a defender," Ellis said.
