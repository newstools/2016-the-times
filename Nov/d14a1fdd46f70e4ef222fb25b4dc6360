The last of the hearings, which took place yesterday in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, looked into living conditions in mining areas, especially in Mpumalanga.SAHRC's acting chairman Mohamed Ameermia, commissioner Janet Love and external panellist Tracy Humby heard submissions from mining companies and representatives of mining-heavy municipalities.But the commissioners were unhappy that the questions posed to some of the mining houses, municipalities and the national government were not answered.Among those present were representatives of Wescoal, Victor Khanye Local Municipality, Mbuyelo Group, Ntshovelo Mining Resources, Glencore, National Nuclear Regulator, Department of Mineral Resources and Fetakgomo-Greater Tubatse Local Municipality.Victor Khanye Local Municipality was chastised for sending a junior official to the hearing."I want the records to show the displeasure of the SAHRC with the way the municipality [disrespects] a Chapter 9 institution when we are looking to find solutions to ongoing unrest," said Ameermia.The municipality's local economic development manager, Sabelo Masina, said most of the protests that took place in the area were related to displeasure with mining.These included concerns surroundingair and water pollution, unemployment, job opportunities being given to "outsiders" and blasting operations.Other municipalities expressed similar problems.Love took issue with those who avoided questions around environmental issues such as pollution.A presentation by Department of Mineral Resources' deputy director-general Joel Raphela drew scathing criticism."My great concern is that, despite sitting in these hearings [for the past five days] you have not drawn in the discourse which was prevalent here," said Humby.She added: "My hope is that you will go into detail in your written submission and not offer platitudes ... We haven't got what we were looking for."
