Mourinho condemned Shaw and Smalling over their apparent unwillingness to play through the pain barrier in Sunday's Premier League win over Swansea City, saying they were not "brave" enough."I was disappointed by that because, knowing the individuals, they are both highly thought of. They've got personal problems, which I don't need to relay," PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said."Sometimes a manager needs to be a psychologist as well and also to be a counsellor because you can't treat everybody in the team [the same], every manager must know that. Every player in a team is different."Smalling has missed several matches with a foot injury but took a pain-killing injection to play against Chelsea last month, said media reports.Shaw, who recently returned after a 10-month injury layoff, has had a mixed start to the campaign and lost his place after Mourinho publicly criticised the 21-year-old after United's loss at Watford in September."It's a short-term career and we're all human beings. I think that's what management these days has to be," Taylor added.
