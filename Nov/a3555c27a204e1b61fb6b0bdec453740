"Suffice to say if they do not EFF will make sure that parliament dissolves them as soon as possible " party spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said. "During his tenure is CEO Molefe had the audacity to lie to parliament when asked about his relations with the Gupta family specifically stating that he has never been to their home when in reality he did. The Eskom board on the other hand is an illegitimate board that should follow its mythomaniac CEO by immediately resigning so that a new board can be appointed..." Ndlozi charged.Corruption Watch echoed the call for the board to step down."Its prominence as a major state owned enterprise requires that the public has confidence in its operations functioning and leadership."The allegations against Molefe... must however continue to be the subject of inquiry by the pending judicial commission of inquiry into state capture and should also be investigated by the relevant law enforcement authorities," it said in a statement.Corruption Watch said any alleged irregular conduct on the part of Molefe was not possible without the consent of the board of Eskom. "The organisation urges the members of the board to consider whether their continued leadership of the parastatal is in fact in the best interests of Eskom."Eskom features prominently in the Public Protector's state capture report which sheds light on the close friendship between Molefe and the Gupta family.The word 'Eskom' appears 829 times.Cellphone records obtained by the Public Protector show that Molefe and Ajay Gupta exchanged 58 calls in eight months between 2015 and 2016.Ajay is one of three brothers the other two being Atol and Rajesh Gupta whose business empire and alleged political influence have stirred up a hornet s nest of controversy in South Africa.The parastatal was a source of lucrative contracts for the Gupta family and Duduzane Zuma the son of President Jacob Zuma through a company called Tegeta.Tegeta secured a 10-year supply agreement with Eskom to supply coal to the Majuba power station. Tegeta also secured contracts to supply coal to the Hendrina and Arnot power stations.Former public protector Thuli Madonsela said in her report that a member of the Gupta family admitted to her during an interview on October 4 2016 that Molefe was his very good friend and often visited his home in the upmarket suburb of Saxonwold Johannesburg. Eskom s awarding of the initial contracts to Tegeta to supply coal to the Majuba Power Station will form part of the next phase of the investigation noted the report by Madonsela.Having considered the evidence uncovered during the investigation Madonsela said that it appeared that the board of Eskom was improperly appointed not in line with the spirit of the King III report on good Corporate Governance.A board appointed to a state-owned-enterprise was expected to act in the best interests of the country at all times but it appears that the board may have failed to do so she said.
