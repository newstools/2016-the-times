This comes after Magaxa fired a first salvo during a press briefing yesterday. He read out a statement accusing Fransman of undermining ANC structures and attacking party secretary-general Gwede Mantashe.Fransman was suspended from the ANC for five years earlier this month. He was charged with misconduct for abusing his office for the purpose of attempting to obtain a sexual favour from Louisa Wynand, and for making public statements "which brought the ANC into disrepute".Magaxa, who is now acting chairman, said Fransman had undermined the work of the party's integrity commission.In response, Fransman's assistant issued a statement."This [Magaxa] is the person that pushed, with no regards for the law and constitution, for the removal of comrade Fransman as leader of the opposition [in the Western Cape].. ."This is the same person that is openly anti-coloured," it read.
