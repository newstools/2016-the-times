So you have to wonder how much faster Albert Einstein might have been able to arrive at his theory of relativity had he watched Amla compress and stretch time and space seemingly at will.It took Einstein almost 10 years to come up with E=mc2.Amla needed less than a second yesterday to dismiss the theory that South Africa's Test series victories in Australia in 2008-2009 and 2012-2013 had significant bearing on the rubber that starts at the Waca in Perth on Thursday."Those things happened four years ago and eight years ago," Amla said. "They are already far in the past. We can only to a certain degree take the experience and the memories from those series."Amla, 33, also put a bullet through the balloon of bluster about targeting key players that has become a focus of the pre-series prattle."Before every series there's always the same questions," he said. "We got asked about David Warner and Steve Smith."There's always going to be two guys you're going to be asked about in the opposition and you are going to say: 'Ja, we've got to get these guys out.' But both teams have got really good batsmen."We've got to get 20 wickets to win the Test match, they've got to get 20 wickets. So I don't look too far into it."I know in our batting order we have got guys who can make an impact at any stage of the game, and that's a really wonderful thing to have in the team."At the crease, Amla deflects the ball more than he gives it a meaty belt in the manner of, say, Quinton de Kock.The same tends to apply at press conferences. Amla considers questions carefully and then caresses them out of the path of any possible controversy.He avoids saying what could be construed as the wrong thing with the same deftness he brings to making his strokes avoid fielders.De Kock smacks questions back from whence they come with, it would seem, not a thought that what he has just said could easily be bent out of shape to fit almost any headline.But yesterday, Amla spoke with a refreshing directness. "On any given day somebody can win the game for the team or put the team in a good position," Amla said."We all want to be that guy every day. Every time we bat I want to be the guy doing it." - TMG Sport
