Penny Andrews, the university's dean of law and the first black academic in that position at the institution, is on a mission to make sure her students do not join the ranks of the unemployed by casting stones at their degrees."By finishing [their] degrees, [they'll] have the power to unsettle the world," she said."If [they] take up this fight at the expense of [their] education, [they] will simply join the ranks of the unemployed and there'll be nothing [they] can do about it." Andrews was an activist at a university in Durban during the liberation struggle. A close friend of hers never finished his degree, she said, like many others who "put liberation before education".But "my education gave me choices and influence that he never had. I grew up in places like Bonteheuwel and Kensington - I know what it takes to overcome all that to get a tertiary education."She came under verbal attack by some students for continuing with the academic year and she was brought to tears at a senate sitting.She said: "Students are hot-headed and they will say stuff. But I am comfortable with what I have done and don't feel like I have to change."Their strategy was to humiliate me, but I don't feel humiliated."Andrews stands by her decision to continue the academic year."I support addressing inequality but I don't support intimidation or throwing rocks or sjambokking other students. I will not tolerate or condone unlawful conduct." #FeesMustFall update: Violence, security for exams and ultimatumsShe said: "You need to build up support for a mass movement, like the UDF (United Democratic Front) or TAC (Treatment Action Campaign) did."You can't go around intimidating people into supporting you."And their call is too broad - unlike the TAC, which took a single issue and focused on it. They have made this all-encompassing call about so many issues. It makes it hard to respond."
