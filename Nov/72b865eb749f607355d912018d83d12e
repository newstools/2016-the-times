 It s not nice losing the best bowler in the world especially knowing you would be reduced to two seamers Rabada said on Monday about the loss of Dale Steyn to a broken shoulder on the second day of the match.That left Rabada Vernon Philander debutant left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj and assorted part-timers to bowl the Australians out twice.They did and South Africa won by 177 runs. I still had the belief that myself Vern Keshav JP and all the other bowlers were going to put their hands up and that happened Rabada said.And none more so than Rabada himself who took match figures of 7/170 - including a haul of 5/92 in the second innings.Not that he was keen to see himself as having stepped into Steyn s boots. I don t see myself as leading the attack Rabada said. I know that I ve got a job to do. Every player has a job to do and so does every other player in the team. So I just try and do my job. Surely there was more to it than that? I sound like a stuck record but I ve got a responsibility to make sure I produce the goods for the country. You ve got a job to do but there s also passion. You do it for your teammates and for the people back home. Because no-one wants to lose right? Rabada is only 21 and he has played just nine tests.But already he asks the right questions and importantly answers them. - TMG Digital
