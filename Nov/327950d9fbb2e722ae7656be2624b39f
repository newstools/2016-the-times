 Having experienced 227% increase in traffic last year we worked incredibly hard to plan for up to five times the usual traffic and we've been really pleased with strong site performance so far. In the course of the day we experienced some challenges at checkout - unfortunately our payment gateway reported that banking processing was feeling the nationwide Black Friday pressure and slowing down checkouts the company told TMG Digital.The site is back up.According to IT company Snapt chief executive Dave Blakey site crashes such as Takealot's caused by high traffic volumes can be avoided with proper IT infrastructure. If not dealt with they can lead to customer loss he said.But Takealot doesn't seem too phased by that with web traffic growing by the hour on Friday. After our initial spike at midnight traffic has been building hourly from the early hours of the morning. At peak times we've welcomed more than 300% of the usual traffic we would expect on a Friday in the festive season. Since we first launched a Black Friday promotion in South Africa back in 2012 we've seen demand grow and grow - last year in 2015 seeing a 260% annual increase in Black Friday orders. The company said it expects its Blue Dot promotion currently running to be the most successful in its history.
