Very little of what we know of his economic agenda makes much sense.America is the very backbone of the post-war world order, economic as well as geopolitical, and of international bodies from the IMF to the WTO and Nato.Trump has promised to turn his back on this liberal consensus, and to retreat behind high tariff walls that could spark the mother of all trade wars.What he'll do in practice, however, is an entirely different matter. There is good reason to believe that, ultimately, pragmatism will prevail.Much depends on the sort of people he surrounds himself with. If he goes for "close down the Fed" cranks , things could get ugly. But why would he?Trump campaign money man Steve Mnuchin, a former investment banker, would make a competent treasury secretary.While Trump's geopolitical ideas might be a major cause for concern, we should be less worried about the economy.Trump is a can-do businessman. Hard-headed pragmatism is more likely to instruct his thinking than populist, self-harming vindictiveness. - The Daily Telegraph
