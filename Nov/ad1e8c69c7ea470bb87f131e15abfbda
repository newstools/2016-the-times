Defeat at the Millennium Stadium condemned the Boks to their eighth loss in 2016 and their first winless northern hemisphere tour since 2002.Strauss, who played his 66th and final Test at the weekend, refused to identify the problems that face rugby in SA, unlike coach Allister Coetzee, who has repeatedly blamed provincial unions."I would like to contribute to solutions for SA rugby," Strauss said. "I'm not a sports administrator or a coach and that's not my ambition."I will reserve my opinions for a platform where they need to be heard, and when I get that chance I will do so honestly and openly, and be ruthless with the truth."I'm not looking for controversy so I won't throw out statements about what needs to change right now. When I get my opportunity at the place and time I will make my contribution."No fingers can be pointed at one person. We are all responsible for where Springbok rugby is, from the bottom of the ladder to the top. We are now in an ideal situation for change and for accountability from all parties."Strauss admitted that the season of captaincy had been demanding but that he never shirked his duty."It's been a massive challenge this year but I accepted it and that day I became accountable," Strauss said."I'm not hoping for a pity party because not only do I take responsibility, I am also responsible and accountable."I did everything I could this year despite making mistakes, which I knew I would. I put the Springboks first and gave it my all."- TMG Digital
