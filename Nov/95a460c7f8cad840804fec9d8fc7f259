Many of the 200 pupils at the community-built Xhentse Senior Secondary School in Libode are forced outdoors when the school s three tiny classrooms cannot cope with the demand for seating space such as during exam times.This situation prevails despite promises by Eastern Cape education bosses five years ago to build them a proper school.A photo posted on social networks by education advocacy group Equal Education went viral last week. The photo shows a group of school children from Xhentse writing their exams outside against a background of green rolling hills.It is true pupils and staff said. A number of pupils at Xhentse are writing their year-end exams under an open sky come wind rain blazing heat and distracting shouts from passersby.Education authorities said on Monday they were aware of the situation.School principal Fikile Qoyi said the photo was of Grade 10 pupils and was taken by Equal Education officials who visited the school last week.This was not the first time exams were written without any shelter from the elements he said. The problem always starts when pupils have to sit for their September trial exams. Grade 12s occupy at least two classes and the other grades have to make way for them he said. When it rains we have to send them home early or even when it is too hot. This has been the norm for a number of years now. Xhentse which is classified as a no-fee school by the government has 221 pupils on its books this year reports The Herald. TMG Digital/The Herald
