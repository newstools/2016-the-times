With news of the state capture report gripping the nation this week, AKA took to his pulpit on Twitter to tell us what it all means.In a lengthy sermon, that's nearly as long as the 355 pages of the report, AKA claimed that the Gupta's "did nothing different to what has been going on in our country for decades" and that their only mistake was that they didn't "steal" quietly enough.In fact, AKA claimed that looting from the state started years ago, and the people to blame are distracting the nation with OPW and sensationalist headlines."In the final days of Apartheid, R25 billion was looted from the state. Where do you think that money went? Into thin air? The same people who looted that 25 billion, are the same people who set the news agenda and run the banks while we sit around and watch OPW. The people who control the news agenda, are the same people distracting you with front page headlines about a tokoloshe killing a goat," AKA tweeted.You expect those same people to report about them stealing 25 billion at the end of Apartheid .... In THEIR newspapers???? Open your eyes. AKA (@akaworldwide) November 3, 2016You expect those same people to report about them stealing 25 billion at the end of Apartheid .... In THEIR newspapers???? Open your eyes.He further claimed that South Africa has had black billionaires but no one to set the proper news agenda.We've had all these black millionaires, black billionaires .... And yet, not one media powerhouse to set OUR agenda. THAT is the problem. AKA (@akaworldwide) November 3, 2016We've had all these black millionaires, black billionaires ....
