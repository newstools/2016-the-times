The walkover will see Murray, 29, move to the top of the rankings for the first time in his career after replacing long-time incumbent Novak Djokovic.Raonic said he had suffered a muscle tear in his right leg in his previous match, sending Murray through to face John Isner in Sunday's final."This morning I had trouble waking up and getting out of bed. So I went to sort of clear any serious diagnosis," said Raonic, who hurt himself in Friday's quarter-final win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga."Did some tests. Did an MRI half an hour ago, let's say. They found that I have a tear, Grade 1 tear in the right quad."Unfortunately, I'm not able to compete against Andy today in the second semi-final."
