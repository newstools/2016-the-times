Speaking to Slikour recently, Cassper said that he had made peace with his rivals in the music industry and that he had planned to have K.O perform at his prestigious Fill Up Orlando Stadium show last month."I tried to call K.O for the show but there were some complications. I wanted K.O to come out at Orlando (stadium). I wanted him to be a part of it for real, not even as a surprise act. I wanted him to be announced as part of the show, just to show everyone that everyone (in the industry) is cool," Cassper said.The pair fell out after Cassper released an angry diss track in 2014, entitled Beef, where he took shots at K.O and claimed that he was richer than him.K.O later made it clear that he did not want to work with Cassper."My focus right now is promoting my album, which just came out. I do not think at this point in time I am in a good space to do collaborations. Again, he (Cassper) did not come up to me in person (to discuss a collaboration). That is something he said estrateni (in the streets) so I do not take that to heart," K.O told Sowetan after the fallout.
