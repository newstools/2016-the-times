You see, Dr Malinga has had his eye on a new tour van for sometime now and decided to express his prayer for one on Instagram this week.Posting a picture of a black Mercedes Benz Sprinter van, Dr Malinga wrote: "I love it! Let me use Doom, maybe I might get it soon. Its more than (R)1million, my Lord, with extras. Amen"And guess what?By the end of the week, Dr Malinga's prayers had been answered and he had a fresh new ride in his garage.And he had no problem showing off the price tag.
