"Generally snakes can t survive for too long in water. The fact that it s a toilet drainage system also gives more reason to believe that the snake can not survive the chemicals in the drain which are not good for its health."It also needs to eat so chances that it will find food in the drain are very slim so I expect it to sneak out to find food. The noise from the drainage system will also work against the snake " Naude who is the chairperson of Snakebite Assistance said.The 2m long snake was found in a toilet at the Glenletta Court in Lynnwood Glen Pretoria around 9am on Thursday by a resident.A snake catcher was filmed trying to remove the serpent which was reportedly clinging onto something in the toilet before it went back inside and was never seen again.Naude added that it was not advisable for residents to try and poison it by using Jeyes fluid acid or pouring toxins down their toilets.Fellow expert Andre Prins said: The snake was in a very uncomfortable state in the sewage system so even though I am not ruling out the possibility that it might still be in there it is highly unlikely. The conditions are not favourable. It is not yet clear how the snake got into the flats but experts suggest that it could have used a broken drainage system or it could belong to someone in the flights. There is a possibility that someone from the flats owns the snake but would not come out and says it is theirs because of the situation as it is at the moment Naude said.Snake catcher Barry Greenshields who has been tasked with going from flat to flat searching for the serpent said there are no signs of the snake except a snake skin which was captured by a camera. We have inserted a camera in about 30m of the drainage system but have not been able to get anything but bits of snake skin which could have come off as it moved around the drains Greenshields said.The snake catcher said the process has been challenging with residents threatening to take the matter into their own hands. I have been confronted by one or two residents saying I should have killed the snake but I didn t. I tell them that I do not kill snakes and one of them said if he comes across the snake he will kill it himself Greenshield added.He added that efforts to capture the snake will continue with a door-to-door search in residents toilets during the course of the week.
