A 10th-minute goal by Thato Thlone, rejected as a junior at Chiefs, opened the scoring in the 2-2 draw after extra time. But it was the goalkeeping heroics of Thela Ngobeni, who played just a single game in five years on Chiefs' books, that ensured the upset result.In the end it was a penalty shootout that produced a second major casualty of the weekend, with Chiefs now joining holders Mamelodi Sundowns on the sidelines of the competition. Stars won 6-5 after a total of 12 spot kicks of heart-stopping drama.Ngobeni made a series of bright stops in the game and two all-important saves in the post-match penalty shootout from Lorenzo Gordinho and George Lebese to become an instant hero.The first goal came quickly as Chiefs lost the ball in midfield and allowed Stars to sweep it out wide to onrushing left back Thlone, who was given space to cut inside by Chiefs' fullback Ramahlwe Mphahlele before firing home a cracking shot with his right foot.But after that goal, it was a grim siege of the Stars goal by Chiefs that matched the wet and murky weather.Bernard Parker, restored to the starting lineup after nine games on the bench, looked lively in attack in tandem with Siphiwe Tshabalala.Orlando Pirates and Supersport United will meet in the semifinal of the Telkom Knockout later this month. Supersport have home advantage for the tie on the weekend of November 26-27. Cape Town City host Free State Stars in the other semifinal.
