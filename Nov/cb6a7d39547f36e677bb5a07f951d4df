The NSPCA said its Wildlife Protection Unit had responded quickly and efficiently to assist the stray zebra which was discovered grazing on a local golf course and a close eye was kept on the animal as arrangements were made to remove her to safety. Details of the matter were relayed at the outset to Gauteng Nature Conservation who gave a general undertaking to go out and look for the animal but to date there has been no record of any Nature Conservation official attending or taking any form of action that could have assisted the zebra the organisation said.The NSPCA borrowed a specialised game trailer from the Johannes Zoo and after being tranquilised the zebra was transported to a wildlife conservancy in the south of Johannesburg. She had sustained minor bruising on her chest and legs from continued running through bush and fences and was duly treated. To enable monitoring by the Veterinarian she was confined in a boma for the first two days. We are delighted to announce that she is progressing well and has been released to join an existing herd of zebra currently on the conservancy the NSPCA said.It added that it remained unknown where she came from. The NSPCA will continue to monitor her progress and will ensure that the rest of her life will be in a non-captive situation with others of her kind. The NSPCA noted the lack of assistance from Gauteng Nature Conservation with grave concern. They are government-funded. We are not. Yet when animals need help it is ourselves the National Council of SPCAs who go out willingly efficiently and with commitment to the immediate and long-term welfare of any animal being helped it stated.
