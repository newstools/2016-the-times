The 70-minute documentary in three parts was recorded on September 2 by production company Forum Films shortly before Derby-Lewis succumbed to cancer.In it he reflected on his life politics and the plot to kill Hani.Hani s assassination by Polish immigrant Januz Walus on April 10 1993 almost plunged the country into a civil war.Limpho Hani speaking at a City of Ekurhuleni event commemorating the life of Chris Hani on Thursday in Boksburg said that she had read about the documentary in newspapers and it did not sit well with her.Asked about the contents of the documentary by TMG Digital she replied: Do you want me to comment on that s**t? She took umbrage saying that she had not been contacted by the makers of the documentary. They have not talked to me she told the gathering. But what has offended me is that the name of our former president Thabo Mbeki is mentioned there she added.Derby-Lewis a former Conservative Party MP mentioned Mbeki in the documentary in a reference to allegedly being visited in prison by former now deceased safety and security minister Steve Tshwete and then justice minister Penuell Maduna who demanded to know if Mbeki had anything to do with the death of Hani.He did not believe Mbeki was involved in the plot. I said I don t know Thabo Mbeki from a bar of soap. I have seen photographs of him from the newspaper. I will never talk to Thabo Mbeki because he is an ANC (member) and the ANC are my enemies said Derby-Lewis.He also said that Limpho Hani had refused to meet him so that he could express his regret for what had happened.Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina officially received the keys to the house of the late struggle icon on Thursday.The house has been purchased by the city as part of its programme to preserve history and heritage.Among the possible uses for the house which has been in private hands since Hani s death is to turn it into a museum where people can learn more about the life and times of the SAPC leader who was gunned down in the property s driveway in 1993.- TMG Digital
