Thanduyise Khuboni profited from a disjointed start by the Clever Boys to put Highlands ahead with a 25-minute penalty.Elias Pelembe s brace in the 42 and 69 saw Gavin Hunt s team s superior class appear to shine through, though Wits made life hard for themselves, especially with the 44-minute dismissal of left-back Sifiso Hlanti.In the fifth minute of injury time Mothobi Mvala s strike saw Highlands smash and grab a point.Wits drew level on 20 points with second-placed Cape Town City, though have the lead with a superior goal difference.Highlands came into the game having won just one game from five in all competitions since Gordon Igesund replaced Allan Freese as coach. The Tembisa-based team clipped at the heels of Wits, spoiled and hacked out of defence, unnerving the more cultured Clever Boys.It was not pretty, but was effective initially. It s not often you see Gavin Hunt s Students rattled in the physical and aggression stakes. The 10-man Clever Boys got cleverer in the second half to edge themselves back into the lead, the blew it right at the end.Wits put together what could well have been their first 45 minutes of the season in the first half, and were fortunate to go to the break at 1-1, though also saddled with being a man down.The rot started when Thulani Hlatshwayo brought down Edwin Sitayitayi in the box, and referee Lwandile Mfiki pointed to the spot. Thanduyise Khuboni slotted to the right of Darren Keet.Wits, normally precise in their play, were guilty of giving the ball away in their own half far too often. Thabang Monare did in fron of Wits area in the 38, and to the wrong man too, allowing Collins Mbesuma to advance a few steps then shoot low and hard onto Keet s right upright.Highlands goalkeeper Tapuwa Kapini s tendency to flap at crosses with one arm saw Wits equalise. The Zimbabwean could only clear Hlanti s cross from deep a few metres, then Mothobi Mvala missed his attempt to hoof away, allowing Elias Pelembe to pick up the loose ball and finish.Wits, though, seemed intent on conspiring to be their own worst enemy. Mhwanazi gave the ball away to allow Sitayitayi to streak towards goal, Hlanti having to come across to foul, and being duly given a straight red by Mfiki.The infringement was just outside the area, and Mvala struck tamely into the wall.Still Wits could not get it right, as another loose pass in midfield led to Mbesuma forcing a save off Keet s legs.Down to 10 men, Wits finally got the skills of Monare and substitute Daine Klate on for Mogakolodi Ngele just after Hlanti s dismissal and dangerous running of Gabadinho Mhango and Pelembe, into the game.From Monare s well-placed cross from deep Mhango headed inches over.Cautiously applying pressure, Wits were rewarded with a goal as scrappy as the game. Thulani Hlatshwayo put his body on the line to win Nazeer Allie s long throw, Pelembe scrambling in a header.Wits had to claw their way through five minutes of added time, Nazeer Allie clearing substitute Kethukuthula Zwane s shot off the line.But the Clever Boys had no such luck when Mvala smashed past Keet for an unlikely equaliser with seconds left.
