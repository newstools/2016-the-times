This comes after the Independent Police Investigative Directorate summonsed Phahlane and charged him with attempting to defeat the ends of justice based on information from O Sulliva n .It is believed that Ipid is investigating Phahlane s ability to afford an R8-million house at the Sabie Hills Waterfront Estate in Pretoria on his official salary.Phahlane said it was unthinkable for a civilian to be a lead investigator in the probe against him. He has invaded the privacy and security of the acting national commissioner,seemingly collaborating with officials charged with the critical function of conducting investigations against any SAPS member, said his spokesman, Brigadier Mashadi Selepe.O Sullivan has denied the accusations. It s ludicrous to suggest I invaded his privacy. He was nowhere near the place. I did not go into his house. Many people go into that estate on a daily basis, he said.Phahlane said he was at no stage approached or informed of any investigation against him by any competent authority .O Sullivan denied being the lead investigator in the case, saying Ipid had many competent investigators .
