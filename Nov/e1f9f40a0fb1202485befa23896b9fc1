"Sensational Ireland create history with stunning victory over the All Blacks," was the online headline of the Irish Independent newspaper after Saturday's 40-29 victory at Soldier Field in Chicago, US.The Irish Times chimed in with "Irish warriors take down All Blacks at Soldier Field."The Irish have been close before - sometimes painfully - but this time, after 111 years and 29 Test matches, they held firm, despite a late surge from the mighty All Blacks, who had won 18 games on the trot before this shock defeat."It's an awesome day for the Irish, not just for this team but for the 28 teams that have gone before us," elated Irish fullback Rob Kearney said after the final whistle.On a state visit to Vietnam, Irish President Michael D Higgins tweeted his praise: "May I congratulate the Irish rugby team with their 40-29 victory over the world champions, the senior men's first victory over New Zealand."Former flyhalf Ronan O'Gara was a lot less formal in his praise."Oh to be an Irish rugby player today.what a feeling.ye are some warriors," he gushed on Twitter.New Zealand will have their chance for revenge in Dublin in two weeks but captain Rory Best believes that the fear of the All Blacks is now a thing of the past."We've created history by going and attacking New Zealand. They're a quality side and it shows how good they are, how important this win was to us," Best said as tears welled in his eyes."You can see how much it means to our boys to have won that. We're absolutely ecstatic."Perhaps the most succinct summing-up of Ireland's achievement was that of former centre Brian O'Driscoll, who took to Twitter to express his delight in two words."So proud," he tweeted, alongside an image of an Irish tricolour flag.The media also had a field day."Magnificent men in green: Ireland make history," trumpeted the New Zealand Herald."Sweet sporting history made," Fairfax New Zealand said on its website.In New Zealand, where rugby is almost a religion, Test losses usually cause national mourning and the more surprising the loss the bigger the hurt.But with nearly one in five New Zealanders also claiming Irish ancestry, this time the usual despondency was replaced by a feeling that if any team deserved to beat the All Blacks, it was Ireland."It's our friends the Irish who broke the record. We kind of feel okay about it," Radio Sport host Tony Veitch said.
