Unlike other workers who wait until the end of the year to celebrate, MPs begin every parliamentary year with a red-carpet event at which the planned work of government is applauded before it has even begun.All the 400 MPs have to do is show up.This week the National Assembly failed to pass key legislation because MPS simply did not arrive at work.As the MPs from the EFF and DA walked out of the House, the ANC and remaining opposition parties were unable to muster the 201 votes needed to approve the Division of Revenue Bill - a bill that allows the national government to pass funding on to provincial government for the provision of services we are promised annually.Oftentimes the revenue bill is a technicality, since the ANC has 249 MPs and the bill needs 201 votes to pass.Yet twice this week funding meant for service delivery could not officially be sent to provinces because MPs could not be bothered to show up.That ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu had to plead with MPs via text message to "please urgently proceed" to the National Assembly to do the jobs they are paid more than R1-million a year to do is a shocking confirmation of how little regard MPs have of their democratic responsibility.Only 40 ANC members actually informed the party leadership of their absence, suggesting MPs also have little regard for those in charge of the party.Considering how full the National Assembly is when MPs show up in defence of President Jacob Zuma, one would imagine the same rationale would apply in defence of legislation needed to ensure that the party's election promises materialise.
