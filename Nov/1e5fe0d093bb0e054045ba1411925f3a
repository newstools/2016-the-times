Second-half goals by Percy Tau in the 55th minute and substitute Khama Billat in the 81st were enough to ease past a well organised and industrious City.Downs played the basics beautifully. Coach Pitso Mosimane made five changes from the tired team that lost 2-1 at against Cape Town City at Loftus Versfeld on Sunday.Ricardo Nascimento, Siyanda Zwane, Lucky Mohomi, Themba Zwane and Teko Modise replaced Thabo Nthethe, Asavela Mbekile, Hlompo Kekana, Tiyani Mabunda and Billiat.The introduction of fringe players in need of game time and hungry to contribute to Downs success did the trick. A refreshed Sundowns were sprightly taking the advantage against City, and some players in need of a run got one.Downs controlled the first half in a measured fashion and created the best chances, without really troubling City goalkeeper George Chigova.The Brazilians had a convincing penalty appeal turned down in the 12th minute when Thapelo Tshilo clipped the heels of Percy Tau.Tebogo Langerman s free-kick came within two feet, with City striker Thobani Mncwango striking a drive from open play similarly close in a rare chance for Polokwane.Zwane s run set up a shot for Mohomi that was blocked and fell to Tau free on the left, 12 metres out, who struck high.Before the break City defender Thabiso Semenya s attempt at a clearance was deflected off team-mate Sibusiso Mbonani and inches wide of goal.Downs deserved a lead and took it when they opened City s defence 10 minutes into the second half.Nascimento s pass out of defence found Modise on the right who released the pace of Thapelo Morena down the wing. Morena s low cross was slammed in at close range by Tau.Polokwane striker Rodney Ramagalela headed Jabu Maluleke s free-kick into Nascimento from close range.In the final 10 minutes Downs scored a classy second, Tau finding space on the right and laying off to Billiat in the middle, whose simple finish was placed past Chigova.
