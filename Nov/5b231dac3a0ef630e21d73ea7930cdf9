The municipality believes the payments ultimately approved by suspended corporate services boss Mod Ndoyana between November 2013 and September 2014 were irregular and unlawful as there was no legal contract in place.It wants the Port Elizabeth High Court to hold Afrisec Strategic Solutions and the other seven people liable for the nine payments over the 10-month period.The seven metro staff who are listed as defendants are Ndoyana chief financial officer Trevor Harper former Integrated Public Transport System (IPTS) boss Mhleli Tshamase fired supply chain contracts controller Sox Nkanjeni legal services official Nobuntu Mgogoshe and former municipal facilities directors Patrick Keble and Armien Madatt.This comes as the metro is involved in another legal matter involving some of its staff and businessman Fareed Fakir in which it is also trying to recoup some of the money squandered on the IPTS.The city believes that Afrisec was commensurately unjustifiably enriched by the municipality and is liable to pay back the R92.4-million.It claims the only binding document between the city and Afrisec was a letter from the municipality in July 2012 accepting Afrisec s tender for the supply and installation of CCTV cameras and other security for municipal buildings.The tender was for three years capped at R5-million.The municipality said no formal contract had ever been signed between the two reports The Herald.- TMG Digital/The Herald
