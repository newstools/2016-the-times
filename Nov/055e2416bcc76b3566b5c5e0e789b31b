The full bench of the high court in Pretoria on Thursday struck the application off the roll for lack of urgency with costs including the costs of two counsel.Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo said the relief sought had the effect of the court straying into the executive terrain and this could lead to the violation of the separation of powers doctrine..In the judgment in which Deputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba and Judge Elizabeth Kubushi concurred Mlambo also said the courts should against creating precedents where based on insufficient grounds ordinary citizens are encouraged to use courts as a platform to dictate to the executive how to do its job.The lobby groups launched an urgent application with the court on November 9 where they sought an order declaring that the failure or refusal of President Jacob Zuma to provisionally suspend the prosecutors and institute enquiries into the fitness of Abrahams and two other prosecutors to hold office is set aside.They also sought an order directing the president to institute enquiries into the fitness of Abrahams head of Priority Crimes Litigation Unit Torie Pretorius SC and Director of Public Prosecutions in North Gauteng Sibongile Mzinyathi to hold office.They sought this relief as a result of the manner in which fraud charges were preferred and later withdrawn against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in two media conferences called by Abrahams last month.However when court proceedings began on Thursday morning the court asked advocates for the groups Zuma and the prosecutors to address the court whether the matter was urgent.The reason for this request was that Zuma had written letters to the prosecutors asking them to give him answers on or before November 28 on why they should not be suspended.Zuma had also requested the organisations on November 7 to give him time to respond to their requests to investigate. The organisations ignored the request and instead went to court.Mlambo had earlier expressed concern to counsel for the groups David Unterhalter SC that the judiciary might be seen to enter into the executive terrain because Zuma had indicated he was doing something following the organisations request that he acts against the prosecutors.Unterhalter said the matter was urgent because for every day the prosecutors remained in office the reputation of the National Prosecuting Authority would be affected and the public would not have confidence in the NPA. However Counsel for Zuma Abrahams Pretorius and Mzinyathi said the application was not urgent.In the judgment Mlambo said the court was of the view that the lobby groups minds were made up when they wrote to the president on November 1 and expected the president to agree with their demands.The court said the organisations launched the court application within two days of receiving a request from Zuma that he needed more timer. The president s request for more time under the circumstances was not unreasonable. This presents clear evidence that the president was considering the matter. Our view is that based on the president s response it was ill-advised of the applicants to rush and launch this application brushing aside the request for more time from the president Mlambo said.
