Faf du Plessis' eyes shone with pride, satisfaction and amazement that his men could play well enough to take eight wickets in less than a session to clinch not only the match, but the series.Steve Smith skulked pale and grim, his eyes hidden in the shadow cast mercifully by the peak of his cap. His jaw was set square and sorry, and he would be forgiven a few tears in private."They've got a full strength team; there's no injuries," Du Plessis said. "So to come here and do what we've done is right up there, certainly in my career."We know how hard it is. We watched on TV for so many years how hard it was for South Africa to come here and do well."The younger guys watching at home can know it's possible to come here and, to an extent, dominate an Australian team."It's extremely special for us because we know this is something we will remember forever as a team. That's exactly what we came here to do. We want to create memories as a team."Now they face new frontiers in the shape of the third match of the series in Adelaide next Thursday.Not only will that game be South Africa's first pink-ball Test, it will also give them the chance to become the only team to beat Australia 3-0 at home."That's the mission for us now, we want to do that very badly. "We've got Australia in a position where they are under pressure and we don't want to let that go. It's hard enough to get them in this position so we'll do everything we can to keep them there."
