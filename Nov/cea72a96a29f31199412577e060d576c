Business Day reported that a geological study had concluded that it would be almost impossible to safely construct a nuclear power station at Thyspunt near Jeffrey s Bay because of deep canyons in the bedrock hidden by sand and soft rock.Thyspunt 90km from Port Elizabeth is one of Eskom s three sites identified for possible construction of a power station and is now the preferred site.In 2015 Eskom applied for nuclear installation site licences for Thyspunt and Duynefontein in the Western Cape.The study by the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University s Africa Earth Observatory Unit also concluded that the area was at risk of storm surges as a result of climate change and that it risked devastation from tsunamis."That work was incorporated in the Thyspunt seismic hazard calculations and is reflected in the seismic design input that will be used for the design of the power stations " Eskom said in a statement."At Thyspunt aquifer systems and valleys/canyons beneath the sands may not be able to protect large tidal swamps and/or tsunami waves from flooding across the bedrock below sea level. Thus it would appear irresponsible to build a nuclear power station at this site " the report read.
