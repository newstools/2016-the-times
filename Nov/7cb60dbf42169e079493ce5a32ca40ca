"I shouted at him because he called me and said: 'I'm leaving you something, my queen. I just put a verse on your song. I'm leaving you something big, I hope you use it wisely'. I shouted at him. I said: 'You're leaving? Where to?' I swore at him because I thought he was joking," Mshoza revealed to TshisaLIVE recently.Mandoza even requested that she join him at the Thank You SABC concert- the star's last public performance before his death."I asked him for the last time where he was going to? Is he moving out? Where was he was travelling to? They even made Mshoza T-shirts for the event but I told him that I would not be coming and I would see him on Monday at the studio. He tried to convince me but I didn't go," Mshoza said.Holding back a tear, Mshoza revealed that Mandoza was one of her closest friends in the industry."The person I was closest to in the industry, after Lebo Mathosa died, was Mandoza. He was a man so we couldn't be that close but we spoke often and were close. I was so shocked and heartbroken when I heard (that he had died). We looked after each other," she said.Taking a deep breath to compose herself, she recounted how Mandoza had phoned her office to tell her that he had put down a deposit on a new car but felt like God didn't want him to get it because he was going blind."I believe now that people can see when they are about to go. He knew it," Mshoza said. </img> Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
