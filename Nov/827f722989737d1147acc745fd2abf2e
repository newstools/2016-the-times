A photo posted by The Feather Awards SA (@featherssa) on Nov 16, 2016 at 3:14am PST This comes after news that Lerato, who was named as host a few weeks ago, had to withdraw from the gig, because she had prior commitments."Due to unforeseen circumstances it is with regret that Lerato Kganyago has had to withdraw as the official host of the 2016 annual Feather Awards. The decision was made during an open discussion on Wednesday 09 November between the event organisers and Lerato herself, prompted by standing career commitments. The organisers voiced their understanding in this regard," read a statement from Lerato's camp.And as you might very well know, Khanya is not the only TV personality that has been given very little time to prepare to host an awards show.Just recently, Bonang Matheba not only hosted, but slayed one of the biggest awards shows in the continent: the 2016 MAMAs. She was given less than 24 hours to prepare. She replaced Trevor Noah, who had a severe respiratory and ear infection.
