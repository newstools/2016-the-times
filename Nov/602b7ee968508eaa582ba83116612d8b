The area has seen the heavy downpours in the past two days and hundreds of people in informal settlements have been displaced. More rain is forecast for the weekend. We are being proactive because we are aware that these rains will continue through the weekend mayoral spokesman Zweli Dlamini said. The city believes that establishing temporary shelters will go a long way to assist our people and could be the best way to save lives. He said shelter will be provided in municipal halls and tents will also be set up.Seventy-three people in Ulana Boksburg have already been given temporary shelter - at an old Spoornet facility. They were also provided with food parcels and blankets.The metro was collecting data to determine which other areas were adversely affected by the rains so that everyone could be assisted according to Dlamini.
