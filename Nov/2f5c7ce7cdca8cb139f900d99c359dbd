Noele Wood of Table View woke up to find a spatchcock chicken in her pool on Monday and took to the Table View Neighbours Facebook page to share her odd discovery the following day. Just fished out my pool anyone lost a spatchcock and before anyone asks no it was not doing the breast stroke lol Wood wrote.The post quickly went viral with her friends wading in with speculations on how the chicken got there and who it belonged to. I heard that a crow stole a defrosted chicken the other day perhaps it dropped it. lol that s serious Diane Stokell said.Claire Balsdon took a similar tack: Maybe a crow or something pinched someone's dinner defrosting but it got too heavy when they were over your pool. The mystery of the missing spatchcock is now solved. Another user Sue Delport Gizzahr joked: "Someone s Sunday braai just resurfaced. Andrea Lachner plunged in with: Heck I know the wind has been super-strong but not that strong! Lol how close are your neighbours? Someone perhaps threw it in? Jeepers this is bizarre because yes these things are really heavy for a bird to pick up crazy!! Must be an early chrissy [Christmas] pressie from Kentucky " Joyce Johnson joked.The plot thickened when another neighbour claimed ownership of the chicken. So sorry my chicken landed up in your swimming pool but yes the crow did steal it I m not kidding you Karen Betheldo said.But that did not stop the speculation and Monika Hegetschweiler suggested: Someone threw someone's dinner out the door! Someone s hubbie out there is in deep k*k. Attempts by TMG Digital to get hold of Wood and Betheldo were unsuccessful. TMG Digital
