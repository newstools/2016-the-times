Opposition and ANC MPs are expected to grill him about his last-minute decision not to prosecute Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, just weeks after emphatically stating that he had a strong case of fraud to prosecute."We have seen Abrahams' public comments and they have raised more questions than answers," said DA MP Werner Horn.Corne Mulder of the FF+, which is pushing for Abrahams' suspension, said the party wanted to know how he came to his conclusion on the Gordhan case."It's not something that came out of the blue. He had to have applied his mind."It is understood that ANC MPs will also be tough on Abrahams."Do I intend stepping down? I have not considered it yet. But I will always do what is right," he said.
