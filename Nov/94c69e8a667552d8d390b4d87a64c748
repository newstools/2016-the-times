Nematandani was suspended by the SA Football Association in 2012 following a pre-2010 World Cup match-fixing scandal.Predator Association CEO Carla van der Vyver said Nematandani had been a coopted member of the association s council since April. She said that although Nematandani had no direct connection to the breeding, keeping or hunting of lions, he was passionate about the industry and about the conservation of lions.Asked if he supported the breeding and hunting of lions in captivity, Nematandani replied: I wouldn t be a member [of the Predator Association] if I did not understand what I do. Would he hunt lions himself? If the opportunity arises, yes. But he would not be drawn on his plans for the association, merely saying he had benefits to add .Stewart Dorrington, a former president of the Professional Hunting Association of SA, said the Predator Association had no credibility and he questioned the choice of Nemat andani. The Professional Hunting Association and numerous international scientists have agreed that captive-bred and hunted lions have absolutely no conservation value at all. But there is significant financial value. The Professional Hunting Association said the trophyhunting industry contributes about R1.8-billion to South Africa s GDP.
