"Since April 2015, when large popular protests broke out against the decision by President Pierre Nkurunziza to seek a third term, Burundi has been in violent political crisis," the International Federation for Human Rights said."We must stop this descent into hell," said the organisation's president, Dimitris Christopoulos. "Let us act before it is too late."In a 200-page report the human rights group documented how state-sponsored violence and opposing rebel groups have perpetuated a cycle of violence."The crackdown by the security services and the [ruling party's youth wing] Imbonerakure . aims primarily at retaining power through any and all means," the report said.More than 1000 people have died, between 300 and 800 are missing, about 8000 are being held for political reasons and more than 300,000 people have fled the country, says the report titled Repression and Genocidal Dynamics in Burundi.The organisation, with leading Burundian rights group the Iteka League, spent 24 months investigating rights abuses in the country."All the criteria and conditions for perpetrating genocide are in place," the report says, listing "ideology, intent, security institutions . identifying populations to be eliminated".Burundi suffered a brutal civil war from 1993 to 2006 between majority Hutus and minority Tutsis, which claimed about 300000 lives.A failed coup in May 2015 was the "breaking point" after which the authorities adopted a "logic of systematic repression", the report says.After Nkurunziza's re-election in July 2015, the repression deepened, it says, citing targeted killings and massive arbitrary detentions. Ethnic Hutus in power "have sought to turn a political crisis into an ethnic one, equating 'opponents' and 'rebels' with Tutsis".Anschaire Nikoyagize, the now-exiled president of Iteka League, said: "The crimes of the regime have become systematic . Crimes against humanity are occurring and there is a risk of genocide."Today Burundi has become increasingly isolated from the international community, notably by withdrawing from the International Criminal Court.ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said she was considering a full investigation into allegations of murder, torture, rape and forced disappearances - in what Bujumbura described as a "plot to do harm to Burundi".The International Federation for Human Rights labelled Burundi's decision to quit the court as "an admission of guilt" by Nkurunziza's regime.Two other African countries, South Africa and the Gambia, have followed Burundi's lead and announced plans to withdraw from the court.
