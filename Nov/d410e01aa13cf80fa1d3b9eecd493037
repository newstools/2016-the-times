Menzo blasted the South African Football Association (Safa) for failing to keep him and the club abreast with the situation around an ankle injury that Coetzee suffered last weekend in the 2-1 win over Senegal in the World Cup qualifier in Polokwane. I would think that it is normal that they [Safa] should contact me and our medical team just to tell us what is happening with him said the former Dutch international who has taken over from Roger de Sa. We have loaned him to them for the week and it is not us who should be running around trying to find out what is going on with our player. I hope that there can be better communication between Safa and the club in the future. Normally I like to make up my mind about my line-up 24 hours before the game but Rivaldo s ankle is still receiving treatment and I am giving him another 24 hours because he is such a key player for us. Hopefully he will tell me before the game that he can play for the full 90 minutes because if he can t then I won t use him Menzo told a press conference in Cape Town on Friday.The 53-year-old former head of Ajax s academy makes his home debut at Cape Town Stadium as first team boss on Saturday night as the bottom-placed club continue their search for a first win of the season.His first game in charge two weeks ago away against Free State Stars produced a potentially vital point and gave Menzo heart in terms of the potential of the players under his charge. I was very satisfied with the will to win that the players showed the willingness they had to fight for the point he said. In the end we almost had three points. But one point was satisfactory for me.
