I will have to frame the shirt. Wembley is the best stage for a debut," Herrera told reporters.Herrera came on when Spain were trailing 2-0 but Isco and Iago Aspas scored in the dying minutes to earn the visitors a draw."The fightback showed our footballing ability and character. We finished the game very strongly. Another team would have surrendered, but we did not give up," the Manchester United player said.
