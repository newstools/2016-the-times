"Last night I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans," Clinton told supporters and staff at a Manhattan hotel.Possibly facing her last opportunity for a presidential run, Clinton, 69, acknowledged Tuesday night's results were painful and that she was disappointed.sShe urged her assembled staff and supporters, deflated after recent national opinion polls indicated a good chance at victory, to continue to work for a better nation."This is painful and it will be for a long time," Clinton said. "But I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted.""This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we shared and the vision we hold for our country," she said to cheers.The former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state said the election results showed the nation was deeply divided, but the voters had spoken."Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."A wealthy real estate developer and former reality TV host, Trump rode a wave of anger toward Washington insiders to win Tuesday's White House race against Clinton, the Democratic candidate whose gold-plated establishment resume included stints as a first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state.President Barack Obama, who campaigned hard against Trump, invited the Republican to the White House for a meeting on Thursday. Obama is due to speak later on Wednesday about the election."Ensuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the President identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the President-elect is the next step," the White House said.
