Pitso Mosimane had Steve Komphela as his assistant when he was national team coach forging a close relationship but all that bonhomie will be forgotten by the time of kickoff (3.30pm) when two of the giants of the domestic game clash.It is the 10th time they sit on opposite benches pitting their wits against each other.Both were rookie coaches 13 years ago now when they first went up against each other and Komphela s Dynamos beat SuperSport United 3-1 away in convincing fashion.It was almost a decade later that they met again in Mosimane s first match after taking over at Sundowns following the firing of Johan Neeskens. A difficult away game at Free State Stars delivered a much-needed and morale-boosting point.Since then Mosimane has not lost to his colleague but not dominated either. There have been three wins for Mosimane s Sundowns against Komphela who after Stars went to work at Maritzburg United and then Kaizer Chiefs.In total Mosimane has three wins to one for Komphela with five draws including the two league meetings between the two clubs last season.
