City travel to Bloemfontein Celtic for their next encounter on Sunday at Petrus Molemela Stadium (3.30pm) before they return to Polokwane to host Free State Stars this coming Wednesday. Eymael believes these are the types of games his side should be winning if they are to finish in the top half of the table come the end of the season. For us these are important games if we want to remain high up on the table and in the top eight because we are playing teams that if I can say are at the same level as us Eymael told TMG Sport. So it is very important that we stay focused on the job that we try to have a good game and most importantly that we try to win the three points are very important. Celtic are a team who try to play good football while Free State Stars play more defensively and look to counter-attack. "They have different styles and this is something we will have to adapt to. Celtic especially are a bit under pressure. Their fans are disappointed with how things have gone. But I said to my players we must just focus on our doing our jobs and realise the importance of these kinds of games to the club. Eymael has been boosted by the return to full fitness of Thobani Mncwango who played the last two matches carrying an injury. But still sidelined is experienced defender Thapelo Tshilo who will is likely to sit out the next few weeks. He has a problem with a lateral ligament. He also has a small fracture in his ankle but this is not the major problem. The ligament is the worry Eymael said. City have not necessarily got the reward for their performances in the last four games two of which resulted in defeats to Mamelodi Sundowns. They were the better side in a 1-1 draw with Orlando Pirates and also undone by a 97th-minute equaliser in a 2-2 stalemate with Baroka FC in the Polokwane Derby. Victory on Sunday could see them move to within a point of fourth-placed Lamontville Golden Arrows though if results go their way. - TMG Sport
