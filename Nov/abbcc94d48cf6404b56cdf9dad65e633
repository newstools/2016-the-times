Chairperson of the DA s federal executive James Selfe said it was apparent that the judges understood the force of the DA s arguments and that the party was confident that it would be successful. This case has now gone on for a very long time. The first part of our action against Mr Motsoeneng was heard in 2014. It has been three times to the Western Cape High court once to the SCA and now this action. Mr Motsoeneng appears impervious to the damning criticism contained in the Public Protector s report and in successive judgements by the High court and the SCA. It is clear the Mr Motsoeneng exercises a toxic influence on the SABC on its board and over the minister. That has got to end if the SABC is going to correct itself Selfe said. It is very simple what needs to happen - Mr Motsoeneng needs to be removed from the SABC until such time as he has either faced a satisfactory disciplinary hearing and/or the findings and remedial action by PP have been reviewed and set aside by another court. The fact that this has dragged on for so long speaks volumes about the contempt Mr Motsoeneng has in particular for the SABC and more generally for the PP and for the rule of law Selfe added.
