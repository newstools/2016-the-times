This was revealed yesterday by Moses Dlamini, a spokesman for the police watchdog, after it emerged that Ipid was to charge Phahlane with attempting to defeat the ends of justice."We take the death threat against our investigator seriously and we will be working hard to identify its source," Dlamini said, adding he would not comment further to avoid jeopardising the investigation.It is believed that Ipid is investigating Phahlane's ability to afford a multimillion-rand house at the Sable Hills Waterfront Estate in Pretoria. It has been alleged that Phahlane contacted witnesses after he learned of the Ipid probe.Phahlane said he welcomed any investigation of allegations against him. The director of The Helen Suzman Foundation, Francis Antonie, said yesterday that it was worrying that someone appointed to uphold the law was being accused of such a serious charge."We do not want to prejudge the matter but, given what has happened in other areas around the police, we are concerned."The current national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, is on suspension pending the outcome of an inquiry into her fitness to hold office."This [investigation] shows some positive signs that things are moving but in general we are concerned about the state of our criminal justice system."The investigation into Phahlane's affairs is being conducted at a time when the security and justice clusters are in the spotlight because of a purported feud between the National Prosecuting Authority and the Hawks.
