Terence Kelly, a Dubliner known as "Taliban Terry" or "Khalid Kelly", was killed after he drove an armoured truck laden with explosives at an Iraqi militia group at the weekend, said IS, which referred to him by the nom de guerre Abu Osama Irelandi.Kelly's death brings a violent end to the Irish nurse's journey through radical Islam.He was raised Catholic but took a job in a Saudi Arabian hospital in the 1990s. He was arrested for illegally making alcohol in his flat and in prison converted to Islam.On his release he travelled to Britain, where he called publicly for attacks on the UK.In 2011 he was arrested for threatening Obama. He was released without charge but began to speak out in support of the IS tactics of beheading aid workers and journalists.His suicide bombing had little effect on the advance into Mosul. Shia militia have since captured the village in which Kelly blew himself up.IS has launched an "unprecedented" wave of suicide bombings, some of the bombers' being children, against advancing Iraqi forces as the terrorist group tries to cling on in Mosul.More than 100 suicide bombers have hurled themselves at Iraqi troops since the Mosul offensive began on October 17, a rate of self-annihilation extreme even by IS standards."It is different from anything we have seen before," said Charlie Winter, of a US monitor of suicide bombing. He recorded 18 suicide attacks in 24 hours.Many attacks have been carried out using improvised armoured vehicles. Iraqi troops showed journalists a Jeep that had been covered with armour plating, leaving only a small square of the windscreen open so that the suicide bomber driver could see his target.The Iraqi army has made swifter than expected progress into Mosul.
