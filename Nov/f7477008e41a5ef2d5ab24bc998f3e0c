The former Dutch international has taken over from Roger de Sa at the struggling coastal club and Mich d Avray who has been assistant to both says Menzo will turn things around for Ajax. Stanley is Ajax through and through. He will bring the Ajax system back to the team."His lack of knowledge of the local scene will be a challenge but there is the support to help him with that said D Avray who won the championship with Cape Town Spurs 21 years ago and is vastly experience.D Avray stood in as coach on Saturday for the 2-0 loss at home to SuperSport United after De Sa quit last Thursday. Menzo was unable to be on the bench because he was not registered.He will make his bow in charge with the team away against Free State Stars in Bethlehem on Wednesday. I think we are just one click away from turning things round. One or two wins will change the mood."Football is a confidence game. If we get one or two wins under our belt we will see the players playing with confidence D Avray added. - TMG Digital
