The short answer is "yes".Those who have bought a new, financed car will know that the financing bank won't allow you to drive the car out of the dealership without insurance.That's because the bank is the title holder and, therefore, has "an insurable interest" in that asset, and to make sure that the policy isn't cancelled by the client down the line, banks often contact the buyer for proof that the policy is still in place.And what if that proof is not forthcoming?Well, says SA Insurance Association chief executive Viviene Pearson, the bank is entitled to impose an insurance policy on the client, but only with his permission, and only after full disclosure about the policy's terms, conditions and premiums."The client must be provided with a quotation; he must consent to both the insurance and the debit order, and he must be sent the policy document after the cover has been agreed to," Pearson said.Contrast that with what happened to Nicole Sharratt, of Durban.She was contacted by Absa at the end of August, first by phone and then by SMS, and asked to e-mail proof of insurance on her Absa-financed car within 14 days, failing which Absa would "automatically insure me".The same day she e-mailed the proof to the address provided, with her ID number in the subject line.About six weeks later, on October 5, she got another SMS, saying that the bank had not received her proof of insurance."I thought that must be a mistake, or perhaps the bank hadn't captured it yet, so I did nothing about it," she said.Then, at the end of October, she got another SMS, again asking her for proof of insurance."I phoned the bank that morning to ask why I was getting these messages. The woman I spoke to checked on the system, said the bank hadn't received my e-mail, and told me to forward the proof to her personal work e-mail address, and she would sort it out."Sharratt did that immediately but on November 1 her Absa debit order was almost R645 more than usual.When she phoned the woman she had dealt with a few days earlier, she was told the extra amount was for an insurance policy because it had already been processed by the time the bank received her proof of insurance. (Absa has an insurance division.)And to get her money back she would have to speak to the bank's vehicle and asset finance division.Note how there was no suggestion that she could handle that for Sharratt as a customer service.That is when I took on the case. Almost immediately Sharratt got a written apology and a refund of the premium.But I wanted to know, among other things, why she was not told when her account would be debited, or anything about the policy and its premium, and how the insurer could have assessed her risk without asking her about what she used the car for and where she parked it at night?Responding, Nelisiwe Baloyi, who heads Absa's vehicle financing division, said the bank's contact centre, which manages the policy confirmation process for the vehicle finance division, "experienced intermittent downtime on its inbound e-mail servers" during September and, as a result, 10 customers who had sent proof of their insurance policies had Absa insurance policies imposed on them and their accounts were debited, because their e-mails were not received. All have since been refunded."A system fix has been deployed to prevent occurrences of this nature in the future," Baloyi said.As for the unilateral way in which the policy was imposed, Baloyi supplied a detailed breakdown of the bank's policy, including contacting the client multiple times in multiple ways before imposing the insurance policy, and then sending them an SMS when it was loaded. What is missing is providing the client with a quotation and getting his consent.Sharratt got no prior notification that the policy had been loaded in her name, much less an opportunity to examine its terms and cost.A poor show all round.As for risk underwriting, Baloyi said the bank used "age and gender information, as well as type of vehicle, market value and outstanding capital".On average, 2.2% of the bank's car finance clients had insurance policies imposed on them annually after failing to supply proof of their own, Baloyi said.The financier is entitled to do so, but clearly it needs to be done in a more transparent, inclusive way.CONTACT WENDY:E-mail: consumer@knowler.co.zaTwitter: @wendyknowler DEBIT ORDER DODGE DANGERThere is a spike in Absa car-finance clients cancelling insurance policies or taking "noncomprehensive" policies, which could prove problematic for them if their cars are damaged or stolen, vehicle finance head Nelisiwe Baloyi has warned."Absa has also noted a rise in consumers wrongly disputing debit orders when they are short of cash or in financial difficulties," Baloyi says. "They run the risk of losing out on insurance policy payouts when they claim, due to inconsistent payment history." DID YOU KNOW? About 65% of the cars being driven on South African roads are uninsured.
