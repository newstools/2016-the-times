 The Act protects white people. This is a law passed after the adoption of the Freedom Charter They passed this law reacting to the Freedom Charter because [it] was saying occupy the land wherever you choose to occupy. It s not Malema. It s the Freedom Charter. It s OR Tambo it s Walter Sisulu it s Nelson Mandela who said you must occupy the land Malema said on Monday after appearing in the Bloemfontein Magistrate s Court for contravening the Riotus Assemblies Act.His case was postponed to June 5. The prosecution claims Malema incited instigated commanded or procured his EFF supporters and others to commit a crime namely trespass by illegally occupying any vacant land wherever they found it. Malema accused the ANC is using the Act which was meant to challenge the Freedom Charter against anyone who promotes the aspirations of the future. all we are saying is that if every single clause of the Freedom Charter is implemented our people will be free from economic oppression. The ANC dumped the Freedom Charter in a political dustbin. We went to fetch it. We cleaned it up and they are offended by the fact that we cleaned it up. We are implementing the Freedom Charter. No law that seeks to protect white people will succeed in a democratic South Africa. Malema also vowed that the last apartheid-era president FW de Klerk would be jailed if he became the leader of the country. De Klerk must pray that I don't become president. If I do I will lock him up for many years for killing black people. - TMG Digital
