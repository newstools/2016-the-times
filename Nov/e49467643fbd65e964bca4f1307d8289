Solinas was relatively happy with the performance of his team despite the defeat and accepted that his charges need more creativity and invention going forward. I m happy with the performance of my team the guys performed very well. It s a pity the result didn t go our way and yes we are disappointed Solinas said after the match.Despite a late comeback from Stars who threatened Jackson Mabokgwane's goal on numerous occasions deep in the second half the visitors could just not get on the score sheet. You know sometimes in football you create one chance and you score and you win the game with one opportunity. Sometimes you create more chances and you don t score. Yes we need some improvements in our final third. We need more determination in the last 20 meter because in the first half we had a great opportunity to score. I think we need to improve in the last 20 meter and more determination going into the opposition box."Ea Lla Koto are second from bottom on the Absa Premiership log standings on five points after nine matches but Solinas is keen to move away from the lower reaches of the table. But I saw a lot of positive things I want to thank my team for the performance. We ll keep on fighting. We need to forget this defeat and start thinking about our next game."Solinas is in his second spell with Stars following his appointment in late September to replace David Lavagne. The Frenchman was fired just three games into the season.Goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni was outstanding for Stars.Pirates created a lot of goal scoring chances and could have won by a bigger margin had it not been for the brilliance of the former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns keeper. - TMG Digital
