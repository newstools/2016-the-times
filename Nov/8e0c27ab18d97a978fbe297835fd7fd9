Maimane laid charges against Zuma at the Rosebank police station for contravention of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act."We contend that the State of Capture report by the former public protector, advocate Thuli Madonsela, provides extensive prima facie evidence of corruption, undue influence and interference by President Zuma, members of the Gupta family and other actors - all to further their own personal interests at the expense of the South African people," he said. In his affidavit, Maimane sets out in detail the potential offences allegedly committed by Zuma in terms of the act: general corruption; corrupt activities relating to contracts; contempt, conspiracy and inducement of another person to contravene the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act; and failure to discharge the legal duty to report corruption transactions.He said there were two incidents highlighted in Madonsela's report that showed the president was aware of underhand state dealings.The first related to a submission made by the former CEO of the Government Communication and Information System, Temba Maseko, that Zuma had instructed that funds be deviated to the Gupta-owned The New Age newspaper. The second was the confirmation by Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas that the Gupta family had offered him money to accept the job of finance minister.Maimane said knowingly failing to act against corrupt activity was an offence in itself."If you know clearly that a corrupt act is being committed here, you are obliged to do something," he said.The DA leader said he had received reassurance from the police that the case would be dealt with."The wheels of justice might turn slowly, but they do turn," he said."Acts of corruption steal away from the livelihood of the country."Zuma - who survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament on Thursday last week over allegations of influence-peddling - was studying the report and reserved the right to challenge it in court, the Presidency said after the document was released on November 2. The carefully worded report by Madonsela, who reached the end of her tenure as public protector on October 14, stopped short of asserting that crimes had been committed and called for a judge to investigate the allegations.It focused on allegations that brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta influenced the appointment of cabinet ministers, and called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet and some state-owned companies had acted improperly.Zuma has denied providing special favours for wealthy friends, including the Guptas, who run a business empire from media to mining.They, too, have denied wrongdoing.Eskom CE Brian Molefe announced his resignation a week after he was implicated in the anti-graft report.Molefe denied any wrongdoing but said he was leaving his post in the state-owned company's interest.- BDLive, additional reporting by Reuters
