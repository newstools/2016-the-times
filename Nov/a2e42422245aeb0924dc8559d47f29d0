Speaking to TshisaLIVE, the rapper admitted that it was the "biggest paycheck" that she's ever received since breaking into the music industry."It was the first time that I handled that kind of money," she said.On how she spent the money, she revealed that it went into building her mom a house back in the North West."I'm building my mom a house. It's actually done," she explained."My brother started building the house, but then, because he got married, the process of building the house slowed down a bit as he had to focus on his own family."Fifi pointed out that she had to step in. It was important for her to do that because she's always dreamt of doing something for her mother."With the money I just helped him to finish up the house. It was also a dream of mine to do something for my mom," she said."At the end of the day, home is always where you end up. You don't want to be a star, but end up living in a shack."
