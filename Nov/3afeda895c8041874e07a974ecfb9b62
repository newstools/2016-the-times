Party spokesman Zizi Kodwa confirmed Fransman was due to appear before an ANC national disciplinary committee in Cape Town. His case was referred to the committee by the party's integrity commission earlier this year after it was made public that Louisa Wynand had laid a criminal charge against the ANC leader.Asked if Fransman had been served with papers detailing his charges, Kodwa said: "You must remember he was going to appear the first time, but there was a postponement." In September, Fransman and the disciplinary committee agreed on the postponement.Asked if Wynand would be a witness, Kodwa said only the committee was privy to such information.Fransman could not be reached for comment yesterday, but has maintained there are sinister motives behind the accusations.Speaking to The Times in September, he singled out ANC NEC member and tourism minister Derek Hanekom as one of the party members behind moves to get rid of him as provincial leader. Hanekom is also the ANC's NEC deployee to the province and has recused himself as disciplinary committee chairman due to a conflict of interest.Fransman allegedly recruited Wynand at her workplace on a wine estate near Stellenbosch to be his PA. Days later they travelled to an ANC birthay bash in Rustenburg. During the journey Fransman allegedly made sexual advances and Wynand was also allegedly forced to share a bed with him at a hotel.
