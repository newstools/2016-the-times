The application was lodged on Friday.CASAC noted on Sunday that the FICA Bill had been passed by Parliament in May this year and submitted for the President s assent on June 13 yet the President had taken no action to date. He has neither assented to and signed the Bill nor referred it back to the National Assembly for reconsideration based on any reservations he may have about its constitutionality as is required by section 79(1) of the Constitution. In its letter to the President dated 19 September 2016 CASAC urged the President to comply with his constitutional obligations within 30 days failing which it would approach the courts to intervene and to order his compliance. The 30-day time period expired on Monday 31 October 2016. CASAC has now approached the Constitutional Court for an order declaring that the President has failed to perform his constitutional obligations and ordering the President to either assent to and sign the FICA Bill or alternatively to refer the FICA Bill back to the National Assembly for reconsideration CASAC said.The Bill seeks to strengthen the regulatory framework to combat money laundering and the finance of terrorism and bring South Africa into line with standards set by a global body the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).CASAC said that failure to sign and implement the Bill could have grave consequences for the country s capacity to fight corruption its banking system and in particular correspondent relationships with international banks. The latter could seriously undermine international trade and economic activity it cautioned.TMG Digital
