The Democratic Alliance s (DA) deputy chief whip Mike Waters said Mahlobo told a bald-faced lie in the National Assembly when responding to an oral question from DA MP Prof Belinda Bozzoli he stated that #FeesMustFall student leader and criminally accused Mcebo Dlamini has never been to his home . He further suggested that the visit was not a fact and simply gleaned from a newspaper article Water added. Mahlobo seemed to forget that he himself revealed his relationship with Dlamini when participating in a panel discussion hosted by the Institute for Security Studies on 14 November he declared: And I happen to know Mcebo. He has been to my house several times. The Economic Freedom Fighters Twitter account posted a video clip mash-up of Mahlobo s conflicting statements: Must Watch Minister David Mahlobo lie in Parliament about Mcebo Dlamini being in his house. Must Watch Minister David Mahlobo lie in Parliament about Mcebo Dlamini being in his house pic.twitter.com/h79qSFwWQT The minister has clearly deliberately misled Parliament and in so doing he has contravened the Executive Ethics Code. Waters said that considering how confidently Mahlobo lied about his relationship with Dlamini one can only wonder whether his pained denial of his friendship with self-confessed criminal and rhino horn smuggler Guan Jiang Guang is similarly deceitful .Mahlobo had earlier this week denied links to rhino horn when Guan in an Al Jazeera documentary which aired at the weekend was secretly recorded saying he had a close connection with Mahlobo.Mahlobo is already on Parliament s radar. Its portfolio committee on environmental affairs on Tuesday said his visiting an establishment of people known to be part of criminal syndicates was worrying as it can undermine the confidence of our people in our best efforts in fighting this crime .The committee said it is deeply concerned by the shocking revelations aired during an Al Jazeera television documentary entitled The Poachers Pipeline in which Mr Guan Jian Guang confesses his involvement in the illegal trade of rhino horn .Committee chairperson Phillemon Mapulane said: The committee further notes the allegations by Guan linking Mahlobo in this illicit trade. These are indeed very serious allegations considering the plight of South African rhino populations in the face of an ongoing criminal onslaught on this iconic flagship species. TMG Digital
