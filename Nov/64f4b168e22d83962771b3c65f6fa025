Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Zuma s ex-wife whose term as chairwoman of the AU Commission ends in January, are regarded as front-runners to take over from Zuma as leader of the ANC in 2017, and possibly president in 2019.Under the Constitution, should Zuma resign, Ramaphosa would automatically become acting president for a maximum of 30 days while the National Assembly elects a replacement from its members.Zuma s early exit may "circumvent the possibility of Dlamini-Zuma coming in", Dirk Kotze, a politics professor at the University of SA (Unisa), said. "It provides Ramaphosa with a major advantage. It will, in a sense, resolve the succession process by default."Ramaphosa has a breadth of experience few can match in SA. A lawyer who co-founded the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), he helped negotiate a peaceful end to apartheid and draft SA s first democratic constitution.He lost out to Thabo Mbeki in the contest to succeed Nelson Mandela as president in 1999 and went into business, securing control of the McDonald s franchise in SA and amassing a fortune before returning to full-time politics in 2012 as ANC deputy president.Read the full story on BusinessLIVE
