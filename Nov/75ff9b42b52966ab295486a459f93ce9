The dig came ahead of the ANC Johannesburg branch s press briefing to outline its dissatisfaction with mayor Herman Mashaba s recent cancelling of critical projects in the economic hub. From the outset it must be said that the ANC is a party battling to come to terms with the fact that it is no longer in power in the City of Joburg " said the DA s Khume Ramulifho. At the heart of this struggle is the loss of the power of patronage corruption and luxury. Today s press conference should be seen for what it is petty political opportunism and grandstanding. The ANC has indicated its objection to the recently cancelled projects of the previous ANC administration. These projects were reviewed at a special mayoral committee meeting last week. These projects cost the City R270-million per year and have been correctly labelled as vanity projects."The projects referred to by Ramulifho include among others mushroom farms paper produced from stone and solar-powered bakeries using imported mango flour from South America.Ramulifho said these projects were designed to permit former ANC mayor Parks Tau to advance the illusion of a World Class African City while many communities in Gauteng suffered in abject poverty.He said Tau's administration seemed quite pleased to roll out these programmes when it couldn t deliver the basic conditions for economic growth as the number of unemployed people in the city increased by more than 190 000."On the matter of corruption I stand by mayor Mashaba s point that the previous administration fundamentally failed to address corruption. There are simply too many cases where the bare minimum was done to address the problem while paying lip service to the idea " the chairperson added.According to Ramulifho the new administration is in the process of finalising a number of forensic investigations which will reveal the systemic failure of the previous administration to address corruption.
