The evacuation of 3,800 people from the Stalingrad area of the city came less than two weeks after the demolition of the notorious "Jungle" camp in the northern port city of Calais.Starting at dawn, police arrived to wake people sleeping in tents or on mattresses under an overhead metro line, 15 minutes' walk from the Gare du Nord railway station.The operation proceeded calmly and in orderly fashion, with many migrants confused about where they would be taken on the government-chartered buses but there were no signs of resistance."Where are they taking people? Somewhere in Paris or outside?" asked Abderrahmane, a 19-year-old from Guinea.The area around Stalingrad, a gritty multi-ethnic part of the capital, is a magnet for migrants arriving in Paris and police have repeatedly cleared camps there, only for them to spring back into life days later.But six months before elections, Socialist President Francois Hollande has said he is determined to take refugees off the streets and has said France needs to show them a better welcome.While some activists praise this fresh political will to tackle a long-standing problem, they stress that France has been slow to react to a crisis that has grown in intensity over the last two years.It has lagged behind other countries, Germany in particular, in providing appropriate lodgings for refugees to seek safety."Our worry is always the same: that the facilities in the shelters are absolutely not the same standard," local activist Valerie Osouf told AFP, who criticised dirty and costly hotel rooms being used in some cases.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has announced the creation of the city's first refugee transit camp, which will have an initial capacity for 400 men. It is set to open this month in a disused railway yard in the north of the capital.In Stalingrad, the arrival of the first bus before dawn on Friday was greeted with cheers from a crowd of hundreds of Afghans who had gathered, bags packed, to take it."I don't know where we are going," said 28-year-old Khalid. "The important thing for me is to have my papers. I have been here in a tent for a month, it's good to leave."Most of the people in the Stalingrad camp are from war-wracked Afghanistan and Sudan or the repressive African state of Eritrea.The clearance, which finished around lunchtime when the last bus left, came after authorities began dismantling the "Jungle" camp in Calais on October 24.The squalid settlement, home to up to 10,000 at its height, had served for years as a jumping-off point for migrants attempting to stow away on trucks and trains crossing the Channel to Britain.The last shelters and shacks were torn down last week, which coincided with an increase in the numbers of people sleeping rough in the capital.French authorities deny any link between the destruction of the "Jungle" and the growth in the Stalingrad camp amid growing anger from nearby residents and Hidalgo, the mayor.She complained this week of the "dramatic humanitarian and sanitary situation" in the city's northeast.Also of concern for the government is the need to find enough places in shelters around France.Plans to disperse the "Jungle" migrants in public buildings across the country, including in rural areas, has created unease and resistance from some local mayors.Many migrants, particularly those bussed to far-flung locations, have simply left and returned to Paris or gone back to the north coast to resume their efforts to slip into Britain, activists say."They don't let people know in advance, it's not respectful," said activist Osouf. "People don't know when they get onto the buses where they are going."Europe faces its biggest migrant crisis since World War II with more than 1.5 million people crossing the Mediterranean since 2014 to escape wars or poverty in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.France has welcomed a fraction of the number of asylum seekers who have headed to Germany, which registered 890,000 refugees last year.France received 73,500 new requests in 2015, up 24 percent, according to interior ministry figures.Authorities have forecast 100,000 new requests this year.
