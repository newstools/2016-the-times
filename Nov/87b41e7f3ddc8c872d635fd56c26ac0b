The labour federation was responding to the acquisition of SAB Miller by Anheuser-Busch InBev when the latter revealed that the combined company would shed 5,500 jobs, or 3%, of its workforce."It is not enough to make it a condition that there will be no job losses in two years," Cosatu said.Labour analyst Mamokgethi Molopyane, of Creative Voodoo Consulting, said Cosatu, while raising valid points about the adverse effect transactions have on workers, was drifting into the realm of telling companies how to do business in South Africa."It sounds idealistic and I do not see how it would work in the South African context because in such a merger or acquisition a company would come with its own model of how it wants things to work."I don't see it happening but I do understand where they're coming from," said Molopyane."At the moment Cosatu comes across as making noise about things it should really be very strategic about."
