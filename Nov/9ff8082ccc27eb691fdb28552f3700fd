This came after a Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor Ernst Botha accused an African National Congress (ANC) councillor who had been disrupting the meeting since it began at 10am of sexually assaulting a woman.Council speaker Rachel Mathebe asked Botha to withdraw his statement but he refused. Instead he chose to change his accusation from sexual assault to assault of a sexual nature .ANC councillors proposed that the DA councillor should be suspended for 60 days while others said the councillor he had accused of sexual assault should be excluded for the same amount of time for disrupting the meeting.At 12pm Mathebe put the issue to a vote but that was constantly disrupted by councillors who accused her of being biased towards the DA.Earlier the meeting was once again disrupted as councillors clashed over the public's attendance of council meetings.The issue stemmed from council speaker Rachel Mathebe allegedly being quoted in a newspaper saying that that the public should apply to the municipality to attend council meetings. What you are doing is not correct a group of councillors sang in the chambers.A councillor in the gallery said Mathebe should not have made the statement because the public has always been allowed to attend council meetings even in the last administration.
