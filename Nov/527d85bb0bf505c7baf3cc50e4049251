 As most people will tell you we ve got two leagues in one in the PSL. You ve got the big five in one league and everybody else trying to win the other league."That s basically how it is said the Arrows coach who takes his Durban-based side to meet Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Sunday (3.30pm). If you can mix it up in that top five then you are really punching above your weight. Of course we know it s not going to be easy. As you can see those top five teams are really strong with good players and quality coaches."They have everything at their disposal but that is what makes this league so exciting you can have everything and still lose games. The top five Larsen is referencing are champions Mamelodi Sundowns last season s runners-up Bidvest Wits Kaizer Chiefs Orlando Pirates and SuperSport United.Arrows start the weekend s round of PSL fixtures in fourth place just two points behind leaders Wits. But for us we want to make sure that we are the best of the rest. That includes Platinum Stars Highlands Park Ajax Maritzburg Free State Stars and the rest of the teams."We would expect to get positive results against the likes of Highlands Park Larsen said of their next league outing Larsen said.
