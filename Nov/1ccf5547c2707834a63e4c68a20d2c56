It is always a battle of the best when we face Nigeria Nyandeni said. The rivalry between us started long before our days in the national team and playing against the Super Falcons is always like a cup final regardless of the stage of the tournament. In any case once you are in the last four you can t pick and choose. Those teams did not get there by fluke and to get to the top you have to go past them. It is not going to be an easy game but I am confident we can walk away with victory. We have beaten them before and to do that again we will have to play as a team. It took us three matches to start scoring goals in this tournament. Our confidence levels are on a high after the win against Egypt. Nyandeni said physically-imposing Nigeria have their weaknesses. We have been watching their matches since the start of the tournament and will now analyse them with the technical team the hugely experienced midfielder who has 115 caps for Bafana said. They are a very balanced side just like us and they are not impossible to beat. If we settle early in the match and follow our game tactics then I believe we stand a good chance of overcoming them.
