Clinton is banking on star power to lock in her narrow poll lead, hosting back-to-back weekend pop concerts with Beyonc and Katy Perry and booking a date with President Barack Obama.For his part Trump has embarked on a cross-country odyssey through Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida, North Carolina and New Hampshire.The latest major survey, an ABC-Washington Post tracker, released early yesterday, gave Clinton a five percentage point 48-43 lead.Polling averages are closer.The final 48-hour programmes of both campaigns suggest that the race is closer than either side admits.In the latest sign of the mounting tension and ugly mood, Trump was briefly hustled off stage in Reno, Nevada, on Saturday in a false gun scare.Trump was unruffled though his son retweeted a message implying it was an "assassination attempt". The Secret Service said that agents found no weapon.The unrest broke out when a protester trying to hold up a "Republicans against Trump" sign was wrestled to the ground and attacked by Trump supporters. The man, who said he was a Republican, was briefly detained.Clinton's camp mocked the 70-year-old tycoon's haphazard approach to the electoral map as a sign of panic.But the 69-year-old former secretary of state herself added an extra stopover in Michigan, a state that fellow Democrat Obama won easily in 2012.At his campaign stops the billionaire Republican remained triumphal."In three days we are going to win the great state of Colorado and we are going to win back the White House," Trump said in Denver, Colorado, on Saturday."You are going to be so happy. We are going to start winning again."Trump hit his key themes: promises to tear up free-trade agreements, expel undocumented migrants, rebuild an allegedly depleted US military and purge Washington of corruption.And his fans roared back the same three-word chants: "Build the wall!", "Drain the swamp", "Lock her up!"Clinton's late decision to head to Michigan with Obama today and to add a midnight rally in North Carolina raised eyebrows.Campaign manager Robby Mook dismissed suggestions that Clinton is trying to shore up her crumbling northern firewall."Trump has to win all of these battleground races," he said. "If we win Pennsylvania and Florida, he just has no path."Outside the US, Washington's allies fear that a candidate who threatens to review treaty alliances is within striking distance of the White House and there was scorn in the UK, where Trump effigies were burned at the weekend.
