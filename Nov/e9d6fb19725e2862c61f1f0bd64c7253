But as times have got tougher for investors, midsize businesses like Food Lover's Market are making up the bulk of deals on the continent.With falling commodity prices dragging down growth, some of these deals are souring, big money flows have dried up, and firms are finding it harder to sell or float their investments.The total value of private equity deals in Africa during the first half of this year was just $900-million (about R13-billion), according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association."You need to be a bold investor today," said Andrei Vorobyov, a partner in Bain &amp; Co's Johannesburg office. "I don't think anybody predicted such a decline in commodity prices."Yet while big buyouts are out, the number of smaller private equity deals in Africa is rising, Avca data shows. About 75% of deals in the first half of this year were below $250-million, with most below $100-million.In 2014, about 70% of funds went on buyouts of more than $250-million.A $54-million investment by emerging market private equity firm Actis in Food Lover's Market, a niche chain with 128 stores in 11 countries and $750-million in revenues, is typical of the deals that are closing, despite depreciating currencies."This business is right in the sweet spot of our investment strategy in the sub-Saharan African market," said David Cooke, a director at Actis, which plans to triple the size of Food Lover's Market in five years.As well as economic uncertainty, industry experts say it is still difficult to find investments in Africa on the scale the big funds like.Traditional private equity funds face the constraint of having to cash out of investments at specified times - often within three years and preferably at attractive enough return levels to tee them up for fresh fundraising.That type of investment period does not usually work in Africa, says Riaz Currimjee, founding partner at Surya Capital, an east African-focused investment firm."Things take longer. A five-year investment is not long in frontier markets," he said.The undeveloped state of many of Africa's stock markets as well as volatile currencies add to the difficulties firms face in selling their investments at the right time.According to an Avca survey, currency risk is the biggest obstacle to African private equity.The rand hit record lows against the dollar earlier this year - making it harder for firms that invested in the country two years ago and are approaching the usual exit period to make their move.Since Permira invested in Teraco Data in December 2014 the rand has fallen more than 20% against the US dollar. The firm declined to comment on the deal's status.Countries across the continent have restricted dollar use and imposed other capital controls since the emerging-markets slide, further deterring foreign investment.But Andrew Newington, chief operating officer at Actis, said his fund had no plans to retreat from Africa."These are big countries and they're growing. These markets are not going anywhere. We are committed to them through their cycles."
