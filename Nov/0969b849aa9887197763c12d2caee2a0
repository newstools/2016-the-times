The protest took place at the Durban City Hall under the watchful eye of Metro Police and plain clothes officers.The protest was attended by about 20 people and no permission had been granted for the gathering.The protestors lined both sides of City Hall on Antony Lembede and Pixley kaSeme streets holding placards that called for the heads of National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza and Sars boss Tom Moyane.The Active Citizens Movement has promised to rally more support for Gordhan should he be charged by the NPA in relation to the establishment of the so-called Sars rogue unit.Group spokeswoman Yashica Padia said "We are here this afternoon to say enough is enough. We believe the strategy is to harass the minister thus forcing his resignation so that the the beneficaries of state capture can loot the fiscus with impunity " said Padia."We are saying... stop the corruption. We want clean governance not a government in the interests of a small and minority elite."She said other protests were expected from sister civic organisations like Save SA Johannesburg Against Injustice and the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation.The City Press reported on Sunday that Gordhan was to face fresh charges over the Sars rogue unit next month.However the NPA has said a decision on whether to charge Gorhan again will only be made once the investigation has been concluded.- TMG Digital/The Times
