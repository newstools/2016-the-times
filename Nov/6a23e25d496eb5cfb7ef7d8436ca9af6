Motshekga was speaking outside court where former Johannesburg ANC Youth League leader Patrick Wisani was found guilty of the murder of his girlfriend in September 2015. The ANC is the people's organisation. The interest of the people come first he said. The ANC can't afford to harbour criminals. Criminals and corrupt people must find another home. I think that man [Wisani] was in the wrong organisation in the first place. Motshekga said the ANC supports the good work done by courts to ensure perpetrators are brought to book. As a society we must protect women and children. I am happy to see solidarity and support for human causes " said Motshekga referring to a group of community members and NGOs which had gathered outside the court to support the deceased's family.Wisani had been accused of beating Nosipho Mandleleni to death with a sjambok and broomstick in the room they shared in Yeoville Johannesburg in September 2015.He also faced charges of allegedly assaulting his late partner s twin sister Siphokazi and her friend in May 2016 in an apparent attempt to intimidate Siphokazi into not testifying against him.
