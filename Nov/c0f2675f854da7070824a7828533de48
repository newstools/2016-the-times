City led three times in the game but Baroka kept fighting back before Masina s fine strike finally ousted them from the competition.Lehlohonolo Majoro, with his second goal in as many games, and Bongi Jayiya put the visitors 2-0 up, but by the hour-mark the score was 2-2 as Mathari Mothupa and Jacky Motshegwa dragged them back into the game.Given Mashinkinya looked to have given City the win in injury-time with a superb free-kick, but a minute later Baroka equalised again through Mzwanele Mahashe, the fourth of the campaign for the defender.Penalties looked a real possibility until Masina s strike earned City a second semifinal in their maiden season in the Premier Soccer League.The visitors had the lead inside eight minutes as Aubrey s Ngoma s run into the box was halted, but Lebogang Manyama squared the loose ball to Majoro for the simplest of finishes.Ngoma was the architect of City s second goal as well. His run to the byline provided a deft cross for Jayiya to head home unopposed on 20 minutes.Baroka coach Kgoloko Thobejane was left dismayed by his team s performance and made two substitutions inside the opening 32 minutes, bringing on Jacky Motshegwa and Geofrey Massa for Khalid Aucho and Cleopas Dube respectively.Austrian midfielder Roland Putsche tested home keeper Oscarine Masuluke from 35-yards with a dipping shot but the gloveman was up to it, and Baroka pulled a goal back in first half injury-time to give themselves hope.Mothupa rose above City defender Robyn Johannes to send a looping header past keeper Shu-Aib Walters and into the top corner.Suddenly the visitors looked jittery and Baroka midfielder Marshall Munetsi should have equalised with another headed chance before the halftime whistle. After Manyama and Majoro had spurned opportunities to extend City s lead, the home side drew level with a fantastic strike.The ball fell for Motshegwa 25-yards from goal and he volleyed into the bottom corner of the net with Walters reacting late to the shot.City appeared to have grabbed the win when substitute Mashinkinya curled home a magnificent 35-yard free-kick in the first minute of injury-time, but the drama was not over yet.The visiting defenders stood off Mahashe and allowed him to turn and shoot from the edge of the box a minute later and once again Walters could only watch as the ball flashed past him and into the net.The match went into extra-time and looked to be heading to penalties until a sweeping City moved grabbed the win.Once again the influential Manyama was involved as he teed-up Masina in the penalty box and the forward, who also netted in the last round against Bloemfontein Celtic, rifled the ball past a helpless Masuluke. - TMG Digital
