Analysing gender trends in transport over a decade Statistics South Africa said on Wednesday that the share of females aged 18 years and older with a driver s licence was a little more than 35% in 2003 and 2013.The white population was most likely to be in possession of a driver's license than any other population group with a 79% and 84% respectively while the black African population group was least likely to be in possession of driver s license with 12% and 17% in both 2003 and 2013 respectively.Males dominated irrespective of population group and year. But that could be changing.Between 2003 and 2013 the percentage of females in possession of a driver s license increased by 27%.While black African females were least likely to possess a driver's license in both 2003 and 2013 they experienced the largest increase (122%) in the proportion of people with driver s license during the period.There are more cars on the road in the decade although motorists are a minority with most of the country using public transport.The percentage of South African households with access to a private car increased significantly between 2003 and 2013 from 22 9% to 28 5%.In 2013 35 7% of male-headed households had access to a private car and 17 6% of female-headed households.The most used mode of transport for day travel was as a passenger in a taxi (over 40% of all trips) or car/bakkie (22%).Reasons for travelling included shopping followed by visiting family and friends.Women also travelled for medical reasons either because they needed treatment or they were escorting someone who needed healthcare. For all population groups females were more likely than males to take trips for medical reasons Stats SA said. This finding possibly reflects the fact that the burden of health care often falls in the hands of women. Women often make trips to medical facilities not only for their well-being but to also ensure the well-being of those in their immediate surroundings. It is for this reason that proper infrastructure which ensures easy access to medical and health facilities is important the report noted.
