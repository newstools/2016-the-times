Environmental action group Greenpeace said former public protector Thuli Madonsela's report on state capture released last week confirmed that vested interests and corruption in the energy sector were central to the energy choices made in South Africa."It is no coincidence that Brian Molefe is a key figure in the State of Capture report, and that he and the Eskom board have been running an anti-renewable energy campaign, focused instead on pushing for expensive and unnecessary nuclear energy," said Greenpeace spokesman Helen Dena."This undermines the prioritisation of renewable energy, which would enhance South Africa's energy future, strengthen the economy and deliver affordable, safe, clean electricity," said Dena.DA MP Gordon Mackay said: "In light of the government's own policy documents, preference for nuclear is irrational in law."
