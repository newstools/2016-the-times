South Africa and Senegal have been regular combatants down the years but have met just twice in competitive fixtures both at the African Nations Cup finals.Their only previous victory in seven meetings was last year in the Nelson Mandela Challenge for all intents and purposes a friendly as Mpho Makola scored on debut to give Shakes Mashaba a 1-0 win.That Senegal side was under-strength as well and coach Aliou Cisse has brought a much more powerful selection for this weekend s clash in Polokwane as his side seek to take control of the group ahead of a 10-month break between qualifiers.It took South Africa a decade after their return to international football to face Senegal but an opportunity arose after the sparkling performance of the Lions of Teranga at the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea where they reached the quarterfinals.That side was invited to play in the Nelson Mandela Challenge later in the year and following a 1-1 draw during which Shaun Bartlett netted for Bafana Senegal won 4-1 on penalties.The teams met again two years later in another friendly in Dakar with Siyabonga Nomvethe s early goal not enough as Senegal won 2-1 the visitors fate decided by an Mbulelo Mabizela own goal.Senegal were back in South Africa again for the Nelson Mandela Challenge a year later and triumphed 3-2 with Nomvethe again on the scoresheet along with Sibusiso Zuma.The first competitive meeting between the sides came at the 2008 African Nations Cup finals in Ghana when they met in the pool phase.Elrio van Heerden gave Bafana the lead only for Senegal to equalise through Henri Camara.The teams played to a dour 0-0 friendly draw in Durban in 2012 before clashing in the Nations Cup pool phase again in Equatorial Guinea last year.Again South Africa led thanks to Oupa Manyisa s goal but Kara Mbodji equalised for the west Africans on the hour-mark.Saturday s fixture will be the first time the two nations have met in a World Cup qualifier and perhaps for both the most important meeting to date. - TMG Digital
