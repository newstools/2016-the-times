The Urban Warriors remain rooted to the foot of the table having not won any of their first 10 games this season, but thought they had at least secured a draw before Mekoa s late show.After a goalless first half, the visitors took the lead through Lebohang Mekoa before Mark Mayambela equalised with his first goal in a year. It looked as though it would finish 1-1, before Mekoa burst into the box and rifled the ball past Jody February in the Ajax goal.Meanwhile in Rustenburg Bidvest Wits regained top spot after a 1-0 win over Platinum Stars at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in the late match on Saturday.Eleazar Rodgers won a penalty early in the first half and picked himself up to slot in the spot kick to seal a sixth League win for Wits.Gavin Hunt's men are now sitting pretty at the top of the standings on 19 points from seven outings. Wits are two points ahead of Cape Town City, who enjoyed a brief lead after their 2-1 triumph away at Chippa United. The Milpark outfit have played two less games that second-place City and three ahead of third-placed SuperSport and will look to stretch their lead when they host newly promoted Highlands Park in their next League match on November 23.New Urban Warriors coach Stanley Menzo was without his regular assistant Mich D Avray, who was attending a weeding in Australia, meaning an elevation for MultiChoice Diski Challenge coach Vladislav Heric to the bench.Mayambela provided plenty of sparkle in the opening half, skinning the Maritzburg defence almost at will.He beat two defenders to coast to the byline early on, but selfishly chose to shoot from an impossible angle when a square-ball to one of three waiting teammates would have been a better option.His brilliant ball into the box just eluded Roscoe Pietersen when a touch would likely have taken it past Bongani Mpandle, before Bantu Mzwakali flashed a volley well wide having been set-up by Prince Nxumalo.Ajax piled on the pressure in the opening 35 minutes, but it was Maritzburg who came closest to taking the lead as they spurned a magnificent opportunity.Lebohang Maboe danced into the Ajax box and his square ball beat goalkeeper Jody February, but also the outstretched boot of Kurt Lentjies with the goal at his mercy. Lentjies had an excellent chance to score just before the break as well, but this time was thwarted by a fine stop from February.Lentjies was replaced at halftime and within a minute, the visitors had the lead.Maboe s initial shot was blocked, before the rifled the rebound into the top corner of the net for his first goal in the South African top-flight.Devon Saal had an excellent chance to make it 2-0 five minutes later, but screwed his shot wide of goal.After Nxumalo could only direct his shot at the back post straight at Mpandle, Saal should have made more of an opportunity at the other end when he burst towards goal.But with options left and right, he hung onto the ball too long and Ajax were able to clear.And he had an even better opportunity minutes later when Bandile Shandu played him in on goal, but February made a fine reaction stop to deny Saal the goal.The visitors were made to pay for that profligacy in front of goal as Mayambela showed a touch of class to equalise.United lost the ball in the Ajax half and a sweeping move from the home side saw the ball fall to Mayambela on the edge of the box. His first-time shot arrowed into the net.Thabo Mosadi wasted a great opportunity to give Ajax the lead, before Nxumalo s header that looked destined for the top corner was brilliant tipped over the crossbar by Mpandle.But Mekoa broke Ajax hearts as he burst forward and with quite literally the final kick of the game, steered the ball low past February. - TMG Digital
