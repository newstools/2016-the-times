Elbow surgery forced De Villiers out of South Africa s most recent series a home one-day rubber and a Test tour both against Australia.Under Du Plessis South Africa became the only team to inflict a 5-0 ODI series loss on the Aussies and came with a win of being the first side to hammer them 3-0 at home in Tests.But as selection convenor Linda Zondi did after the visitors clinched the Test series in Hobart two weeks ago Domingo said De Villiers would be back in charge when South Africa return home to take on Sri Lanka next month. AB de Villiers is the appointed captain and once fit he should resume his duties Domingo said after Australia won the third Test in Adelaide by seven wickets on Sunday to narrow the final series scoreline to 2-1 in South Africa s favour. Obviously those decisions get made by the board with suggestions from the selection panel. As far as I know the status quo will remain - AB de Villiers is the guy that s in charge and once fit he will come back into the side. That would be tough on Du Plessis South Africa s appointed T20 captain who has led the Test and one-day teams with assured aplomb and has the success to show for it.But as Domingo said AB de Villiers is one of the best (batsmen) in the world .That said squeezing even someone of De Villiers stature back into an increasingly solid South African batting line-up promises to be a challenge. Obviously I need to sit with the selectors and plot the way forward Domingo said. I m assuming he ll come straight back into the side and somebody will need to make way for him - you can only play 11. TMG Sport
