The president-elect's immigration team was also drafting an executive order for the rapid construction of a wall along the US border with Mexico, said Kris Kobach, Kansas secretary of state and an adviser to Trump.Trump called during his campaign for a "complete shutdown of Muslims" entering the US.To this end, Kobach said his team had suggested reinstating the national security entry-exit registration system, a policy briefly implemented after the September 11 attacks.Under the system, people from countries deemed "higher risk" are required to undergo interrogation and fingerprinting on entering the US. Some male US residents over the age of 16 who are not US citizens were also required to check in at government offices. The system was abandoned in 2011 after it was criticised for "unfairly targeting" immigrants from Muslim nations.Kobach helped design the programme while working in the Department of Justice under President George W Bush.Bill de Blasio, the Democrat mayor of New York, warned Trump against hardline immigration policies that would "sow mistrust". He said he had reminded Trump that the New York police had 900 Muslim employees, and called on the president-elect not to enact immigration policies that would lead to families being "torn apart".Trump yesterday denied reports of chaos in his team."The failing New York Times story is so totally wrong on the transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders," Trump said. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and a close adviser, is reportedly purging the Trump camp of allies of Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor and former leader of the transition team who, when he was a US attorney, prosecuted Kushner's real-estate millionaire father.Trump responded to speculation about appointments by tweeting that only he knows who the "finalists" are, drawing comparisons with his Apprentice reality television show.Democrats in Congress yesterday wrote to Trump asking him to rescind the appointment of Steve Bannon, the Breitbart News executive, as a senior White House adviser."Millions of Americans have expressed fear and concern . and your appointment of Bannon only exacerbates and validates their concerns," they wrote.
