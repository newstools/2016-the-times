Monday s meeting comes as the veterans have been requesting to have a meeting with President Jacob Zuma to address concerns in the party ranks as well as Zuma's fitness to hold office as the leader of the party and county."This meeting is in fulfilment of our commitment we made post August 3 (local government elections) where we spoke about self introspection but broadly to engage to foster unity in the African National Congress " said party spokesperson Zizi Kodwa.He was speaking outside the venue where the meeting is currently taking place at St George's hotel in Irene Pretoria."You would recall that a number of stalwarts whom we are meeting here today have remained a fountain of wisdom of guidance in the leadership of the African National Congress and broadly to the liberation movement for many years " added Kodwa.Earlier this month the stalwarts spoke out about their concerns about the declining state of the country calling for the ANC to hold an early conference to elect new leadership.During a photo opportunity TMG Digital spotted Reverend Frank Chikane Wally Serote Mavuso Msimanga Kgabisi Mosunkutu Denis Goldberg Andrew Mlangeni as well as Ahmed Kathrada among other veterans.As journalists entered the conference room they were given a round of applause from ANC stalwarts as well as a few members of the NWC.Earlier journalists were prevented from entering the premises of the hotel with security officials ensuring that no member of the media was allowed to enter the precinct of the hotel without instructions from ANC bigwigs.The meeting is expected to end later this afternoon or early evening according to Kodwa.
