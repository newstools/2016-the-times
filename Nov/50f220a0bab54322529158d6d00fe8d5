Hassan has represented an array of well-known underworld figures in Cape Town.He was also on multimillionaire businessman Jason Rohde's legal team. Rohde is accused of murdering his wife, Susan.The Times has established that Hassan had been warned by a colleague not to get "too close to the controversial people he represented". He had allegedly "entertained" his clients at his home.According to another source, the People Against Gangsterism and Drugs had personally warned Hassan to stop defending drug dealers.Pagad spokesman Haroon Orrie has, however, denied that the group was involved in the murder.Police spokesman Constable Noloyiso Rwexana said the motive for the murder had not yet been established."This office can confirm that the circumstances surrounding a murder are being investigated after a 45-year-old man was shot and killed last night at around 22:05 in Burwood Road, Lansdowne, by an unknown suspect who is yet to be arrested," said Rwexana yesterday. Fellow criminal lawyer William Booth said everyone charged with a crime was entitled to legal representation."The public needs to know a lawyer is doing his job just as a surgeon is doing his job when he operates on a terrorist," said Booth, who believes Hassan's murder was a "planned attack".Advocate Pete Mihalik sang Hassan's praises."He has defended every person who needed proper representation. He was fearless and he always defended his clients' rights to the best of his ability. He was a fantastic family man," Mihalik said.
