'... Mkhwebane would like to state that the State of Capture report is the property of the Public Protector as an institution it said. If members of the media need any information about the report including how it was released and how the investigation was done the office has the institutional memory to explain all of that. I took over the office with all its successes and failures. That is why I went to Parliament to present an annual report that was not prepared by me. Her office said she is happy to receive specific questions on anything to do with the report and the investigation that preceded it.Former public protector Thuli Madonsela said just after Mkhwebane was quizzed on her report in Parliament two weeks ago that: Firstly it was unfair on her to be expected to defend someone else s report. The Pretoria High Court ordered Mkhwebane to release the report on Wednesday before 5pm.This came after President Jacob Zuma withdrew his application to interdict the release of the report.The report implicated a number of senior government officials and their relationship with the influential Gupta family. Among them were Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane Eskom CEO Brian Molefe and President Jacob Zuma s son Duduzane.
