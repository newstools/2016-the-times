Speaking outside the Johannesburg Central Magistrate's Court on Tuesday after making a brief appearance a defiant Dlamini said: We have always said and maintained that we are not criminals and have been involved in any criminal act. The legal team and their representation is a true reflection of what transpired (during his arrest) he added.On Monday the student leader travelled to Bloemfontein to rally behind Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema who faces a charge of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act for urging people to move onto occupied land.The Bloemfontein Regional Court postponed Malema's case until June 5 next year pending the outcome of an application to challenge the constitutionality of the act."As you remember yesterday I even supported my co-accused in the political ploy in Bloemfontein because I felt that our charges were politically motivated it's clear that [our charges] were politically motivated and it s our role as young people to expose injustice anywhere added Dlamini.Dlamini who is an African National Congress member said the land question was a resolution of the ruling party and that he was there to support a black brother.Dlamini's case on Tuesday was postponed to June 15 2017 and his legal team said it has launched a high court application to have the charges against him withdrawn.Last Tuesday at Dlamini's bail hearing advocates Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi argued that his arrest and prosecution was as a part of a political conspiracy basing their argument on a meeting that took place at the African National Congress Luthuli House headquarters involving National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Kevin Abrahams on 10 OctoberHe was arrested on October 15 at his Wits residence and is facing charges of public violence theft malicious damage to property and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.The outspoken activist was granted bail of R2000 by the Palm Ridge Magistrate's court last Wednesday.
