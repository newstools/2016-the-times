Coach Eric Tinkler says Chiefs are not on form and can be beaten but is more wary about his team chances against his old club where he began his playing and coaching career.After booking a place for themselves in the Telkom Knockout final by beating Free State Stars 4-1 at home on Saturday City play Chiefs at Soccer City on Tuesday night and will then stay on in Johannesburg for Friday s match away against Bidvest Wits. We are going there not just to play the fixtures. I believe we have a good opportunity to get points against Chiefs at this stage. I don t think they are playing the best football they could Tinkler said. I don t think they have the squad of past seasons in my personal opinion. So we need to try and take advantage of that fact. The Wits game is going to be extremely tough because it s a different type of game. With Chiefs you know you are going out there and going to be playing a lot of football. It s going to be possession based. Chiefs are going to want to have the ball; we are going to want to have the ball. But when you play Wits it s pressure football. The way Gavin [Hunt Wits coach] plays the game it s Get the ball into the opponent s half as quick as you can look to play off the second ball . You are confronted with that pressure style. It will be about us being able to adapt in both circumstances. City left on Monday for Johannesburg with an 18-match squad and will fly up two more players on Wednesday to supplement that. That will include central defender Robyn Johannes who is suspended for the Chiefs match.
