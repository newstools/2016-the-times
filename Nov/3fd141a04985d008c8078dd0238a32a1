Mshoza has never been scared to talk about how in love she is with her man, Thuthukani Mvula.But she told TshisaLIVE this week that she is currently "overwhelmed" with work and has decided to "pause" her relationship with the businessman, in order to focus on her career."I've decided to put my relationship on pause. We didn't break up, I just asked for, I don't know, space? I realise that time is ticking and that none of this is benefiting me. I've decided to focus on my music and my business. That and creating a future for my children," she said.The couple's romance made headlines in August when a report in The Citizen claimed that they were preparing to get married.Although her manager later denied the claims, Mshoza told TshisaLIVE this week that the couple's wedding plans were also on ice."I've put it on hold. Marriage is a good thing but it's not a degree. I believe that a woman must be able to handle things on her own. Be independent," she said.It's not all doom and gloom.Mshoza later said that she would "most probably" marry the man she is currently with in the future.
