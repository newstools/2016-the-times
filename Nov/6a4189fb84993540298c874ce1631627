If you didn't pick up the exact words, the accent or the face you might have thought it was Adolf Hitler calling vengeance upon Jews.Actually, it was Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema laying into white people yesterday outside a Bloemfontein courtroom, where he was up on charges of incitement.In his tirade, Malema repeated all the rabble-rousing phrases cited in the charge sheet and issued a whole new set of menacing threats."When we leave here, you will see any beautiful piece of land, you like it, occupy it, it belongs to you. It is the land that was taken from us by white people by force of genocide."Any politician with the good of the country truly at heart could not utter such incendiary words.Meanwhile, in Johannesburg, Harvard history professor Nial Ferguson was warning about the rising global tide of populism.He cited four triggers for populist electoral backlash: increased immigration, corruption, growing inequality and economic woe.Sound familiar? Demagogue leaders exploit this poisonous mix of issues. But, once in power, are never able change things for the better - as seen in Venezuela and Argentina.Malema's words had a surprising echo last week, when Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa referred to whites slaughtering blacks. This outburst indicated an administration rattled by Malema's growing support among poor, jobless millions.With a president deeply compromised by ever-mounting accusations of corruption and political skulduggery, the government must realise it is on shaky legal, moral and electoral ground when it goes after the EFF boss.So it resorts to Malema-speak itself.What a dreadful, dangerous mess we're in.
