Sharon Mkhondo's sister Khensani said the 30-year-old is depressed and refuses to go out following the public humiliation which was recorded and posted on Facebook by one of her attackers.In the 94-second-long video Sharon is seen being attacked by three men and two women who take turns slapping kicking and hitting her with sjamboks while she is on the floor inside a room which echoes her loud unheeded screams for help.They continue to beat her and drag her outside the room to an open area where they take turns kicking and hitting her.Khensani who lives in Lilydale in Bushbuckridge Mpumalanga with her sister said the beating stemmed from an on-going feud Sharon has with one of the women in the video. Sharon and one the women keep having verbal encounters but on that day they provoked her early in the morning by standing outside our yard cursing her. She got mad and had a physical fight with the woman. The woman and her friend left and came back with three other men started cursing her and when she responded they came in and chased her until she was inside the room Khensani said. They left her there half-naked and humiliated. We were helpless and could only run to ask for help but no one could help us. We took her to a hospital as she complained of being in pain all over body. She is very hurt she is still in pain from the heavy beatings. She doesn t want to talk and fears that her attackers might return any minute or send people. Khensani said a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was opened at the Calcutta police station on Monday.WARNING: THIS VIDEO IS NOT FOR SENSITIVE VIEWERSThe spirit of Ubuntu is deadPosted by Magomane Maphoru Abraham on Monday, November 21, 2016The spirit of Ubuntu is dead TMG Digital
