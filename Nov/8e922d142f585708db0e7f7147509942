Cassper told Twitter fans this week that he was doing his all to get playlisted on radio- but with no success.The Mama I Made It rapper recently released a new single, but after radio apparently again, ignored his work, he took to Twitter to beg fans to help him get the song airplay. "Please help me push it. I still don't understand why I don't get radio airplay so I need my fans to request Abashwe . Hope that will help," he told his fans.Cassper went on to explain that he was not ungrateful for the love he has been getting from fans but just wanted them to know that he was working hard.I'm not complaining, my fans are. They think I dont push my music like i don't care about it whereas I'm doing all I can but get no airplay. https://t.co/eG612cRd3w Abuti Fill Up (@CassperNyovest) November 3, 2016I'm not complaining, my fans are.

People want me to chill with them and I'm busy...For me, after doing the Dome, I need to be treated like Beyonc in my country," he told Metro FM. </img> Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
