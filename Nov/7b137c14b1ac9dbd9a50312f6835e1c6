Corruption Watch said it welcomed Molefe s decision because it was in the best interests of the parastatal Eskom while the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) said Molefe s resignation was a setback for the electricity utility. Its prominence as a major state owned enterprise (SOE) requires that the public has confidence in its operations functioning and leadership Corruption Watch said in a statement on Friday.Sanco national spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said: Molefe was one of the best administrators in the public service and state owned enterprises whose skill experience and expertise were still needed to steer the public electricity utility towards efficiency and sustainability through its turnaround strategy. Both organisations stressed that the allegations about Molefe in the public protector s State of Capture report were the subject of a judicial commission of inquiry.Corruption Watch added that the allegations should be investigated by the relevant law enforcement authorities.Mahlangu said the appointment of the judge to head the judicial commission should not be delayed and that the way in which the government and the ANC handled unfolding processes should inspire public confidence otherwise perceptions to the contrary will have adverse consequences .Corruption Watch pointed out that any alleged irregular or criminal conduct on the part of Molefe was not possible without the consent of the Eskom board specifically its chairperson Ben NgubaneThe organisation urged board members to consider whether their continued leadership of the parastatal is in fact in the best interests of Eskom .
