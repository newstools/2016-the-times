The design of the jersey also seeks to provide less distraction for athletes so they can perform at their best.The sides of the home kit features green colour reveal tape that run the length of the shirt and shorts. Expanding when the player is in motion, they are designed to maximize ventilation and reveal bold flashes of green. In the home kit, yellow socks showcase a linear green graphic on the calf. Both highlight the most dynamic part of the footballer s body, the lower legs, to accentuate speed.The away kit has the inverse design on the shirt all green with yellow colour reveal tape on the sides of the shirt.Here is the new SAFA kit for 2016/17 @Banyana_Banyana @BafanaBafana @nikefootball #safabrillianceRoadtoRussia pic.twitter.com/NmhWDfkbNY SAFA.net (@SAFA_net) November 2, 2016 Here is the new SAFA kit for 2016/17 @Banyana_Banyana @BafanaBafana @nikefootball #safabrillianceRoadtoRussia pic.twitter.com/NmhWDfkbNY - SAFA Media/ TMG Digital
