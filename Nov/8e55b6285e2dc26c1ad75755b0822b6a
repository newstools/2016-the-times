The centenary of the Battle of Delville Wood was the theme of yesterday's commemoration but veterans said they were honouring all fallen soldiers.Wreaths were laid and salutes given as the South African national anthem was played.The Rev Gift Moerane, who officiated, said: "We are here to remember what happened to our brothers and sisters. Today I take pride in being a South African, to hear about our army going around the world to reclaim peace."There is no reason for us to go to war. We should look at how we can bring peace to the world."Delville Wood was the scene of the bloodiest fighting for South African troops during World War 1 . The 1st SA Infantry Brigade suffered catastrophic losses. Of the brigade's 3433 soldiers who went into battle that day , only 750 emerged alive six days later.Moerane used the commemoration to call for peace in the world's war-torn regions, including the Middle East, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa."All that has happened in the name of injustices of the past cannot stand. The blood that has been spilled is enough."Brian Smith, a retired army officer and member of the SA Legion, said he wanted to raise awareness of some of the worst South African military tragedies, including the sinking of the Mendi troop ship during World War 1."It was one of the biggest tragedies but so few people know about it," he said.Robin Mark Hogg, a former SA Defence Force soldier and member of the Memorable Order of Tin Hats, said the day "was about fallen comrades".
