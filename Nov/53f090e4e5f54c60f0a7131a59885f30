Pressure has been mounting on the Gupta family and its companies. First there was the closure of the family's bank accounts by the four big banks earlier this year and then the release of the public protector's State of Capture report on November 2, detailing serious allegations against them.In October, there was the bombshell release of a list of 72 "suspicious and unusual" transactions with a value of at least R6.8-billion over four years, in a Financial Intelligence Centre certificate .The FIC certificate was annexed to the founding papers in Gordhan's case, in which he is asking the High Court in Pretoria to declare that, as finance minister, he has no power or obligation to intervene in the relationships between the Guptas and the banks.Oakbay is yet to file its answering papers in court. Instead it launched a new case against the FIC on Friday, asking that a "duly authorised representative" of the Oakbay group "have access to and obtain detailed information" with regard to the certificate.Oakbay acting CEO Ronica Ragavan said in an affidavit that, since the certificate was released, there had been a "huge media response", with reports "slamming" the Gupta family, which affected the business of the Oakbay companies.The State of Capture report did not make "one single adverse conclusion" about the Oakbay companies or the Gupta family, Ragavan said."The applicants have a clear right to protect their commercial interests and good name."Ragavan said the Oakbay group needed the information from the FIC so that it could answer the allegations and "address the misconceptions" created by Gordhan's application.But a request for the information was refused by the FIC, which said that the Oakbay companies were not entitled to "any of the information requested".Ragavan said the Oakbay group had not asked for the identity of the source of the information and that the information could be given to it in a way that protected the source."The applicants do not intend to use the information obtained from the centre for any other reason than to protect their rights."Since the applicants only require access to information about themselves, nobody will be prejudiced by the relief sought," she said. - TMG Digital/BusinessLive
