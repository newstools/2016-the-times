National Prosecution Authority spokesman Frank Lesenyego said the pre-trial conference was postponed to give National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams time to respond to the representations submitted by the lawyers of the accused. Lesenyego would not disclose details of the documents but said at the next court date it would be determined whether the case would be withdrawn due to lack of evidence struck of the court roll or a date set for trial. "It is difficult to divulge the contents of the documents submitted by the accuseds' lawyers. The NDPP will [take its] time and decide on a way forward on this case " he said. Anele Zonke and 18 others were arrested in August 2012 and are facing charges of murder robbery malicious damage to property and unlawful possession of firearms.The pre-trial conference was postponed to February 20 next year. - TMG Digital/SowetanLIVE
