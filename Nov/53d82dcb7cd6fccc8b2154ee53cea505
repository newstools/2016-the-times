The I-Pace, making its debut at the Los Angeles Motor Show, will be Jaguar's first purely electric vehicle. It will take the form of an SUV to rival the recently launched Tesla Model X, albeit with a sleeker profile.It is claimed that the new car will have a range, on a single charge, of 499km, and that it will be able to accelerate from 0-100km an hour in about four seconds, meaning it will rival all but the very fastest sports cars.The all-wheel-drive I-Pace will have two electric motors that will produce close to 298kW and 700Nm of torque, all powered by a 90kWh lithium-ion battery.Jaguar boasts that the car will have "precise, agile driving dynamics as yet unseen in an electric vehicle".As Tesla has done with its Model3 electric vehicle, Jaguar is inviting people to register their interest on its website. Using a similar method, Tesla secured more than 400000 pre-orders for the Model3, despite it not being ready until the end of next year.The five-seat SUV will go on sale next year - the price is yet to be announced - and is said to have been created as a result of Jaguar's design and engineering teams tearing up the rule book to "create a bespoke electric architecture, matched by dramatic design".Ian Callum, design director for Jaguar, enthused: "The I-Pace represents the next generation of electric vehicle design."
