"President Zuma is the president of the ANC so he's not going to malls to shop for acceptance because he was elected by congress so he remains president as such and all of us in the ANC support him until next year when his term ends " said ANCYL president Collen Maine on Monday.This comes as several organisations and individuals who have previously expressed their dissatisfaction with Zuma have joined forces in their call for him to step down."We are not going to be told by the media which is controlled by white people what to think what to say about our leadership and yes we appreciate that there are challenges facing or movement " said Maine.Sipho Pityana the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution former finance minister Trevor Manuel the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation CEO Shan Bolton and one of the Occupy Luthuli House organisers Gugu Ndima are just some of the members of the Save South Africa steering committee which says it was born out of a deep concern over Zuma's leadership.Last week Save South Africa pushed ahead with the march in Pretoria with the aim of "addressing the acute social crisis that has been brought about by corruption mismanagement and political intrigue".They demanded that Zuma step down.Youth League spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize labelled those who formed under the banner of Save South Africa as stooges of "white monopoly capital". - TMG Digital
