This year, 58018 pupils will write matric after being pushed through Grade 11 despite not meeting the grade's requirements. Of the 65 671 "progressed" pupils who wrote last year, just over a third passed.The call to review the policy, which resulted in more than 120000 pupils being pushed through to matric in the past two years, was made by the MPs who last week visited Eastern Cape's Matatiele region, where four school principals told them that the policy was one of the reasons for lower-than-expected matric pass rates.Nyaniso Senior Secondary School principal Bonginkosi Dzingwa told the MPs: "Progressed pupils have a negative attitude. They do not want to work. They get 30% but we are expected to produce a bachelor's pass."Phello Parkies, an ANC MP and leader of the National Council of Provinces team, said the policy was "an issue we need to engage on".Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said the policy had had an adverse effect on the pass rate. The 2015 pass rate was 70.7% but without the progressed pupils it would have been 74.1%.Parkies said that all four of the principals met by the delegation were worried about the policy so it had to be looked at."Policy is not static. It's supposed to be dynamic. And if that policy has unintended consequences then that policy must be reviewed to respond to what is happening."I'm not saying that the policy must change; I am saying that the governing party must [reconsider] if that policy has unintended consequences," said Parkies.The general secretary of the SA Democratic Teachers' Union in KwaZulu-Natal, Nomarashiya Caluza, criticised the policy, saying that it "walked" unready pupilsinto matric."The problem is with the policy itself. To progress learners that have not passed Grade 11 and you take them to Grade 12 without a programme to assist them is a serious problem because those learners are going to fail and the majority of them fail throughout the year."The department is failing to put resources in place to assist those learners; they just push them into Grade 12. A person who moves to Grade 12 must [have] passed Grade 11," she said.Basic Education Department spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said the policy was needed to support pupils who were not coping.
