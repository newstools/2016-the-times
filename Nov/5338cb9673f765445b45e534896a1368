The Doha centre runs South African doping tests.South African Institute for Drug-Free Sport's (Saids) CEO Khalid Galant said "There is a global network of Wada-accredited laboratories and we will use those that are the most cost-efficient"."This means that the turn-around time of results might be affected by a few extra days because of longer transportation times but the accuracy of testing will not be compromised " he said.The World Anti-Doping Agency suspended the accreditation of the Doha lab for at least four months with the laboratory required to "address all non-conformities identified by the Laboratory Expert Group or Wada" it said in a statement.Saids started sending samples to Doha in March this while the South African Doping Control Laboratory at the University of Free State in Bloemfontein temporarily shut down part of its operation and subsequently also had its accreditation revoked in May."Saids would like to re-iterate that it will continue drug testing in sport as part of its mandate to protect clean sport in South Africa " Galant added.- TMG Digital/The Times
