If she isn't being called out for apparently not attending church or her song getting trolled for being about drugs (it's not) then she has had to face criticism about her talent.But she took to Instagram recently to explain that despite the tough times, she still finds inspiration."Life is a lot of work. What is it that gives us the strength to continue when we are tired and burned out? Sometimes an inspirational idea can help us renew ourselves and be filled with strength to fulfill our life's purpose.""Inspiration comes in many forms. However, the root of all inspiration is the idea that our lives are meaningful. Inspiration is knowing that what I do matters deeply to the universe. When you have the feeling that your actions are meaningful, you will become filled with strength and vigor to fulfill your life's purpose," she added.
