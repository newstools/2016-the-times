"At the time of the operation no one was present on the premises " said police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andr Traut."However the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the abalone are being investigated and the possibility of arrests is not excluded."Traut said the raid was a product of police efforts to "break the back" of abalone poaching in the Western Cape. Abalone drying equipment was also confiscated."We will continue with our stern stance against the lucrative marine resources trade and will pursue every avenue in this regard " said Traut.Friday's raid came just five days after the army and navy were deployed along the south Cape coast to stop thousands of abalone poachers.A task force that includes the South African National Defence Force the South African Revenue Service the Department of Home Affairs the police and the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries is patrolling areas such as Gansbaai and Pearly Beach.A source close to the operation said its focus was on visible policing and keeping poachers out of the water .This is the second time in three years that troops have been used in campaigns against poaching.Beverley Schafer chairman of the standing committee for economic opportunities tourism and agriculture in the Western Cape legislature said abalone smuggling was a national security threat .She said the authorities were losing the war on abalone poaching resulting in the need for extraordinary measures . A WWF [World Wide Fund for Nature] report published in August said that illegal harvesting of abalone in South Africa accounts for more than 90% of total abalone production with a value of more than R1-billion. South Africa loses seven million abalone to poachers every year she said.A series of high-level busts by the Hawks the police and the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries culminated four weeks ago in the arrest in Boksburg on the East Rand of the alleged ringleaders of a transnational abalone smuggling syndicate.Hawks spokesman Captain Lloyd Ramovha said two men a South African and a Chinese were arrested for smuggling R13-million of abalone.Ramovha said tackling abalone smuggling was a priority because it involved high-level criminal enterprises . We believe our multi-disciplinary approach is bearing fruit as shown by [frequent] busts said Ramovha.He said it was necessary to educate people about the importance of protecting endangered species. Abalone fishermen say they are terrorised by poaching gangs.Abalone diver Michael W rbach said that traditional fishing communities have lost a generation of young people because of the trading of cheap drugs from Asia for abalone.
