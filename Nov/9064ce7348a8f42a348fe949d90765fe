In the past, minimum wages have been set sector-by-sector and have been negotiated between trade unions and employers. This has allowed flexibility in setting pay but has also led to "strike seasons" during which workers can be guaranteed to down tools to renegotiate wages.It is with this in mind that Ramaphosa's announcement should be welcomed.Agreeing on the "magic number", as Ramaphosa has called it in the past, will go a long way in helping settle labour instability, which the ratings agencies - due to decide on South Africa's sovereign credit status next month - have consistently said is adversely affecting the country's prospects.Research by Wits academic Gilad Isaacs, who examined the effects on inequality and poverty reduction of the introduction of a minimum wage in other countries, argued that it could be just what South Africa needs to strengthen its economy by increasing the buying power of employees.But we are not there yet.Over the coming weeks and months the proposal will be debated and commented on in the hopes of reaching a consensus.We hope that robust discussion takes place at national, provincial, and community level to determine whether the amount is right. Should it be more or less? What effect will it have on unemployment? How will its implementation be monitored, and what support will the government provide?We hope that those involved can transcend party politics, factionalism and union affiliation to put the needs of the worker and, by extension, the country first.And we hope that once the minimum wage is signed into law it is implemented and monitored - for in truth we have too many laws that are good only on paper.
