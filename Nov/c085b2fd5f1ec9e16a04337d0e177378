Besides the hair loss and constantly feeling ill, Zoleka has also gained weight.Not one to sit around and wallow in her troubles, Zoleka took to the treadmill recently in an effort to fight the weight gain.Alongside an Instagram clip of herself running, Zoleka revealed that she's carrying an excess weight of 16.4kgs, which makes it hard for her to exercise."My fat stomach, fat thighs and fat booty make it so difficult for me to jog as you can see in this video! My arms are heavy too with all the [excess] weight I'm carrying, 16.4kgs in total," she wrote.However, she won't let that get in her way of shedding a few pounds."I look ridiculous but I'm doing something about losing weight and not sitting on the couch eating take out."A video posted by Zoleka Mandela (@zolekamandela) on Nov 28, 2016 at 8:16am PST
