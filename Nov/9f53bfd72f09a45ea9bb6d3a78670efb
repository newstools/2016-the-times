Sundowns have taken the matter to the Premier Soccer League s DRC with the original hearing postponed from November 14 to Tuesday.The proceedings started on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday November 30. The heads of argument of both sides are being presented in the current hearing.The DRC will then deliberate on the matter and present an outcome in the coming weeks.Sundowns are contesting a European buyout clause believed to be a sum of R12-million in Dolly s second contract with the club. The club are claiming the new sum different from in the midfielder s first contract was a mistake.They are attempting to have what they assert to be a mistake changed by the legal process of rectification. According to the SA Institute of Chartered Accountants: Where a person applies to court to 'rectify' a contract that he has entered into he is asserting that the written contract as it stands does not accurately reflect the true intention of the parties and he is asking the court to order that the contract be rephrased so as to accurately reflect the true mutual agreement of the parties at the time they entered into their agreement. The dispute is standing in the way of a proposed move for Dolly to Greek club Olympiacos who have matched the amount stipulated in the player s current buyout clause.Dolly s legal representatives have argued that the contract was signed and agreed on by both parties 15 months ago and has remained unchanged with Sundowns only claiming a mistake after a European club matched the amount in the buyout clause.Dolly has attracted interest internationally with his performances for Bafana Bafana for the SA Under-23 team at the Rio Olympics in August and as part of the Sundowns team that won the Caf Champions League last month.Dolly has been out injured with shin splints. He may come off the bench for Downs in Wednesday night's PSL game against Ajax Cape Town at Cape Town Stadium. TMG Sport
