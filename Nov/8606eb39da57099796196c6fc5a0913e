Fortunately an SA Navy harbour patrol boat came to the aid of the stricken yacht Mystic Rhythm which was stranded about two nautical miles east of Simonstown in the Western Cape.When a National Sea Rescue Institute crew from Simonstown arrived on the scene after responding to a distress call from the yacht it found it under tow of the naval patrol boat after her crew had extinguished a fire in the yacht s engine room. The Navy boat had taken her under tow as the casualty yacht was drifting towards the line of fire of an SA Navy gunnery exercise. NSRI took over the tow so that the Navy Harbour Patrol boat could return to safety duty for the gunnery exercise said NSRI Simonstown station commander Darren Zimmerman. We towed the yacht safely to her berth at False Bay Yacht Club (FBYC) without incident and no further assistance was required he added.
