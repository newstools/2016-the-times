A much-needed win after only four victories in 10 Tests this season would give the Boks a huge boost with Wales looming in Cardiff next week.But equally defeat would make Coetzee s position untenable.Flank Nizaam Carr makes his first start in the familiar openside role which he played under Coetzee when he was Stormers coach.Wing Bryan Habana returns for his 124th Test cap while the bench sees three changes with prop Trevor Nyakane flank Teboho Mohoje and flyhalf Elton Jantjies all coming in after last week s 37-21 loss to England.With conditions expected to be wet and cool the Bok pack with Pieter-Steph du Toit returning to his more natural lock role will have to set the foundation. The fact that the halfbacks and the centres are unchanged from last week will add some continuity and hopefully more fluidity to the team s attack and more structure to its defence. Italy will ask questions at the breakdown where Carr will have to curb his natural instincts to fulfil a linking role while Willem Alberts ball-carrying will be crucial to get the Boks over the gainline. Hopefully we can take a step closer to becoming the team we want to be on Saturday captain Adriaan Strauss said. It will be a physical battle but first and foremost we have to be clinical. We haven t done that for 80 minutes this season. I m totally focused on being processes-driven I ve always been like that. Coach Allister Coetzee said this week we had to take a step up in everything we do which included the training sessions. Within the training sessions every aspect had to be better. On match day our processes lineouts scrums breakdown finishing and defence all have to improve. Winning is massively important and even though our focus is not on the end result in itself but we need a win.
