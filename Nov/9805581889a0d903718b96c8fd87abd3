It said this follows more evidence that emerged in the media on Sunday detailing Motsoeneng s obvious unfitness to hold any senior position at the SABC. As the DA s case against Motsoeneng is set to be heard on Wednesday and Thursday 23 and 24 November 2016 the DA will now file a supplementary affidavit containing the information revealed in the media today which will add to the already extensive list of reasons as to why Mr Motsoeneng is wholly unfit to hold any position at the national broadcaster and why he should be removed immediately said chairperson of the DA s federal executive James Selfe.He said reports on Sunday showed: - Motsoeneng did not adhere to the SABC policy on Request for Proposals (RFP) approved in 2014 and thereby defied the SABC s own commissioning policy; - By ignoring those RFP procedures and then failing to approve a new Commissioning Protocol Policy as industry watchdog The Independent Communications Authority of SA (Icasa) requires Motsoeneng contravened Icasa regulations; - Motsoeneng bullied and abused the SABC s former group executive for television Verona Duwarkah; - Motsoeneng implemented the 80% local TV content quota without conducting a risk assessment; - Motsoeneng commissioned R600 million worth of local TV shows for which he brought in celebrity actors as producers through a back door.In October the DA filed its founding affidavit in the Western Cape High Court to have the appointment of Motsoeneng as Group Executive of Corporate Affairs declared invalid. In essence the DA is asking the court to confirm that Mr Motsoeneng is unfit to hold any position at the SABC said Selfe.While it was not ideal to approach the courts the DA firmly believed that the SABC Board now comprising of one member and the Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi had failed in their duty to maintain the integrity of the national broadcaster Selfe said. Therefore the DA was left with little choice but to request that the courts intervene in the interest of the public to prevent Mr Motsoeneng from continuing his one-man wrecking ball routine. The DA is committed to restoring the integrity and independence of the SABC. The first vital step towards this objective is the removal of Mr Motsoeneng. Motsoeneng was reappointed in his former position as group executive of corporate affairs at the national public broadcaster after a court declared his appointment as the SABC s chief operating officer to be unlawful.
