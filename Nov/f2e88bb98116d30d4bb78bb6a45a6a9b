"If all those parents that are seeking offers of placement do not confirm by the end of today we will give those offers to other parents who are on standby " Gauteng Education spokesperson Oupa Bodibe told TMG Digital on Friday.He said the department wanted to close the whole online process by the end of November. This means that parents who still wanted to apply for late applications and be placed on standby still have time to apply.To date the department has received 303 707 applications and have placed 193 363 pupils at schools. Of the 303 707 70 000 were late applications said Bodibe.The admission period for next year began on April 11 and was meant to end on September 7. The department then extended the closing date.The online application cannot be used to apply for Grade R and schools for children with special educational needs the department said.The department said it had opted for an online application process because it is convenient easy to access and enables planning and fair distribution of children across the Gauteng education system.
