The North Gauteng High Court has ordered that the Public Protector's office do this by 5pm on Wednesday. Our web team (State Information Technology Agency) SITA and site host are working on restoring the page spokesperson Oupa Segalwe said.The court made this order after President Jacob Zuma withdrew his application to interdict the report when his application was due to be heard earlier on Wednesday.The court said the president should pay the costs of the withdrawal of the application on an attorney and client scale. The question of whether Zuma should pay these costs in his personal capacity was reserved.Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo requested the parties to file supplemental papers on this question within seven days.The report concerning an investigation into complaints regarding any alleged improper and unethical conduct by Zuma and any other persons related to alleged improper relationships with the Gupta family was finalised by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela and she meant to release it on her last day in office on October 14.However the applications by Zuma and Coperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen to interdict the release of the report thwarted her plans. The court on Tuesday dismissed Van Rooyen's second attempt to prevent the release of the report with costs for lack of urgency. - TMG Digital/The Times
