This was on Monday after the sluice gates of the Sterkfontein Dam near Harrismith Free State were opened allowing water to flow to the Vaal Dam with the aim of keeping it at least 25% full.Sterkfontein Dam is a reserve water source only used in times of need.In a statement the portfolio committee welcomed the move by the Department of Water and Sanitation but said the water reserves must not be taken for granted."Communities have to be reminded that we continue to face one of the most debilitating droughts and they must take steps to reduce consumption. The responsibility is upon every individual to make a conscious decision to conserve the little water we currently have to avoid worsening an already dire situation " said Mlungisi Johnson the chairperson of the portfolio committee.The committee urged municipalities to monitor residents closely ensuring compliance with restrictions."By-laws must be implemented to the letter and fines must be issued for those that defy the restrictions " said Johnson.The Vaal Dam provides water to many of Gauteng's municipalities including the economic hub of Johannesburg.Ekurhuleni will begin rolling out water rationing on Monday night between the hours of 9PM and 5AM. The city has warned residents to reduce water use or suffer day-time rationing too.Johannesburg Water spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene said on Monday that level three water restrictions should be treated as the city's last resort but that may have to be considered if the water saving target of 15% was not reached."If we are not able to make the saving we want we will need to go to level three. But we are reluctant to go to level three due to the serious implications for infrastructure. We need to make it work at level two " she said.Ekurhuleni last month started levying penalties for excessive water use. To date about 3000 businesses and 41 000 households have used water in excess of the allowed amounts. The city has charged R1.7 million in penalties. - TMG Digital
