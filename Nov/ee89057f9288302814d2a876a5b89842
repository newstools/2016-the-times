The High Court in Cape Town is hearing an application brought by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to have Motsoeneng removed from the SABC where we was recently appointed group executive of corporate affairs.The DA s application lists the SABC as the second respondent.The public broadcaster s lawyer Stephan du Toit argued on Thursday that it was not for the courts to dictate to the SABC who it can employ. He said acting SABC CEO James Aguma was entitled to allocate portfolios to employees. Him [Motsoeneng] holding that position is really a business decision taken by the CEO He [Motsoeneng] is a glorified public relations officer ... [this] is not a defining role as he had as chief operating officer he now has a subordinate role said Du Toit.The DA launched its latest court bid to remove Motsoeneng from the SABC after the broadcaster controversially reappointed him to his old position of group executive of corporate affairs.This was after he lost his job as SABC chief operating officer in September when the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed his application for leave to appeal against a ruling by the High Court in Cape Town which set aside his permanent appointment as COO.His reappointment as an executive precipitated the resignation of two board members in Parliament in October.The board has just one member left and Parliament is due to hold an inquiry to look into the crisis at the SABC later in November.The DA argues that Motsoeneng is an unethical manipulative fraudster who has destroyed any semblance of good corporate governance at the SABC and should therefore not hold any influential position. The DA trying to prescribe to SABC who they may employ it will set a bad precedent if a political party comes along and tells us who to employ said Du Toit.Anton Katz for the DA argued in court that Motsoeneng was a toxic cancer that needs to be cut from the body [of the SABC] .Katz said Motsoeneng was still very much an influential figure at the SABC even though he held a different position. Motsoeneng was still in the same physical office as when he was as chief operating officer said Katz.The Office of the Public Protector argued in court that Motsoeneng should not hold any position of influence that requires honesty and integrity at the SABC because he was found to have been dishonest.Motsoeneng s legal troubles stem from former public protector Thuli Madonsela s findings against him in 2014.In her report entitled When Governance and Ethics Fail Madonsela found Motsoeneng had fabricated his matric qualification and had increased his salary irregularly from R1.5-million to R2.4-million in one year.A disciplinary hearing cleared Motsoeneng of wrongdoing but the DA says the process was a sham and a charade .The disciplinary inquiry was one of the remedial actions directed by Madonsela in her report.The SABC is challenging the public protector s report and further argues that it will be premature for the courts to make a decision on Motsoeneng s future until its review application has been dealt with.
