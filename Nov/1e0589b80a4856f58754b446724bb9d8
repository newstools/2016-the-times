In a series of tweets, the outspoken poet and activist, once again, expressed her dislike for weaves. She claimed that it's an attempt for black women to like others.Yup..... pic.twitter.com/Akp0EgJcFQNtsiki, who happens to be an ambassador for a hair care range, suggested that black girls who wear weaves have a "crisis of assimilation". U dnt have to...u just feel touched when i tweet cos u know its true. Black girl crisis of assimilation https://t.co/It2iu9D1OdSoon after, her tirade on weaves bred an unsavoury response from Twitter users, who don't believe a black girl's worth should be measured by their hair.@ntsikimazwai @Afrika__N Our worth is in our hair? UnxilileNtsiki stood firm in her thoughts, saying that black girls should embrace their natural hair, and not be "desperate to look like others".She also said that "weaves are much dirtier than natural hair"."For as long as you run away from what [you] truly look like....you're punishing yourself," she continued."Chasing other identities makes [you] look damn insecure....ngathi awuzithembanga [it's like you don't trust yourself]."
