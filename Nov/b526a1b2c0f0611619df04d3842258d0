Opener Cook was 81 not out at stumps which South Africa reached on 194/6 for a lead of 70. Cookie is just one of those hard-working cricketers sort of old school Neil McKenzie South Africa s batting coach said. He does it his way and he doesn t always look pretty. But he s got a method that works for him. Mentally he s right up there with some of the toughest guys who are playing cricket at this stage. He s endured a lot of noise about his technique and about how he goes about things but I m very happy for him. Quinton de Kock who faced three fizzing deliveries from off-spinner Nathan Lyon to survive the close will resume with Cook on Sunday.Australia were dismissed for 383 in their first innings in reply to South Africa s declaration of 259/9.The home side resumed on 307/6 and lost their first wicket of the day in the seventh over when Vernon Philander trapped Usman Khawaja in front with a delivery that straightened after pitching.Khawaja batted on all three days of the match for his 145 in which he faced 308 balls and hit 12 fours.Mitchell Starc scored 53 before he was caught and bowled by Kagiso Rabada for 53.Debutant left-arm spinner Tabraiz Shamsi took his maiden test wicket when he had a sweeping Nathan Lyon caught at leg slip.Rabada ended the innings by having Jackson Bird well held by Faf du Plessis at second slip.Kyle Abbott who took all his wickets on Friday finished with 3/49 while Rabada took 3/84.South Africa lost Dean Elgar with just a run on the board when the opener edged Starc and was well caught by Steve Smith at second slip.Stephen Cook and Hashim Amla steadied the innings with a stand of 81 - which was ended eight overs before dinner when Josh Hazlewood had Amla caught behind for 45.JP Duminy Faf du Plessis and Temba Bavuma all made it into double figures but also all failed to show the stickability that kept Cook at the crease.Lyon proved to the sharpest thorn in South Africa s side removing Duminy and Bavuma in his bag of 3/48. - TMG Digital
