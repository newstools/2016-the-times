The Barbarians, with four South Africans in their starting line-up and a host of players from New Zealand and Australian Super Rugby sides, were almost always ahead on the scoreboard, creating trademark running moves that the Springboks' defence struggled to deal with as both sides scored five tries.South Africa, who have had a poor season and barely edged Argentina into last place in the southern hemisphere's Rugby Championship, had the better of the set pieces but will need a marked improvement against England at Twickenham.South Africa started with six uncapped players, wingers Sergeal Petersen and Jamba Ulengo, centres Francois Venter and Rohan Janse van Rensburg, flanker Roelof Smit and lock RG Snyman as coach Allister Coetzee looks for his best XV following a humiliating 57-15 drubbing by New Zealand in Durban last month.Venter and Ronhan Janse van Rensburg both scored late tries as the Springboks rescued a 31-31 draw with the Barbarians in their European tour opener at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday.The Springboks were 31-19 down with nine minutes left in this non-cap clash before their midfield duo scored the last of the game's 10 tries.South Africa also play Italy on Nov. 19 and Wales a week later on their European tour.
