And while everybody loves a good yarn, people used to know the difference between fiction and fact.We can blame it on the changing media landscape, in which social media sites such as Facebook and Google are becoming more popular sources of news than conventional - more carefully curated - journalistic organisations. We can blame it on the proliferation of lies sprouted by public figures, or on trends in mainstream journalism, which include the juniorisation of newsrooms in an increasingly post-truth world.Or we could blame the way we zigzag around the web, guided by recommendations from friends and followers without considering the reliability of the sources of our information, let alone of the authors. Or perhaps the lack of accountability of the purveyors of misinformation is behind it all.Whatever reason we choose to justify how gullible we've become when it comes to consuming news, there's no denying that more and more fake stories are evading our truthfulness detectors and satire radars.As children, we had to go to the library to look up facts. It took some effort. But the ease with which information can be accessed now, thanks to the internet, has made us lazy.Although Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is taking steps to prevent fake news from appearing on his platform and on Google, these are open platforms, not content gatekeepers.The onus is on us, as readers, to make an effort to check facts, note sources, take responsibility and not repost, retweet or in any other way pass on fake stories.As we wait for the standards for sharing information to evolve to the point at which we have more protection against misinformation, we would do well to remember that you shouldn't always believe what you read.
