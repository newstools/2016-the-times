The four-hour-long session followed veterans requesting to have a meeting with President Jacob Zuma to address concerns in the party ranks as well as Zuma's fitness to hold office as the leader of the party and county."One of the most important things is that we met face-to-face and engaged. They [veterans] have given us a number of issues many of them quite difficult to resolve in one meeting " said ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe.He was speaking on Monday outside St George's hotel in Irene Pretoria where the meeting was held."What we have committed to do is to have a follow-up meeting before the close of December. The way we take this matter serious is that we want to give the first meeting of the NEC (national executive committee) to the veterans then continue with meeting over two days " said Mantashe.Earlier this month the stalwarts spoke out about their concerns about the declining state of the country calling for the ANC to hold an early conference to elect new leadership or a consultative conference.The call for consultative conference is also an agenda point that is being discussed at the NWC meeting.Mantashe admitted that the meeting was a bit heated where "difficult" and "robust" matters were aired by the stalwarts. He was unable to elaborate on those matters saying they will pronounce in due course.Also present at the briefing was ANC stalwart Wally Serote who when asked if they called for the Zuma to step down during the meeting rubbished claims that stalwarts ever made such a collective pronouncement saying those who did so did it in their personal capacity."We have never done that... some of them have but as a group of veterans we have never called for the president to resign. We are saying if people utter (calls for the president to resign) they do so in their personal capacities not as veterans " said Serote."We had very robust discussions [and] there were difficult moments [and] we will address them. There also many issues that we agreed upon and therefore we are guided by the President when he said let us meet " added Serote.Earlier journalists were prevented from entering the premises of the hotel with security officials ensuring that no member of the media was allowed to enter the precinct of the hotel without instructions from ANC bigwigs.
