This is according to a survey conducted by the Gauteng Liquor Forum, the SA Liquor Traders Association and the National Tourism Hospitality Association, which represent the interests of 35000 small businesses.The survey was held after the Department of Trade and Industry proposed to introduce the amendments to the Liquor Act 59 of 2003.The amendments propose that the legal drinking age be increased from 18 to 21, among other restrictions.The survey found that:Liquor Traders Association president Mish Hlophe said small- business owners would be the hardest hit by the amendments."By adding laws that are not feasible or workable in the township environment, the ministers are pushing us into crisis," Hlophe said.
