Chris Welman had dollied up the old hotel and given it a new name, but business had not picked up until he purchased that television set from the Chinese shop in Ramoutsa. When it was delivered, there was quite a crowd to watch it being unloaded from the government lorry and installed by an electrician, who had come all the way from Zeerust to make sure that the picture was clear.Jurie Steyn said that after they had started showing the rugby matches live on that television, he no longer had anyone to talk to, or drink coffee with, in his voorkamer."If you can't beat 'em, join 'em," his wife had said, which I am sure she later came to regret.So Jurie Steyn decided to spend all his Saturdays in the sports bar, neglecting his duties as the Derdepoort postmaster.Last Saturday he wished he were back in his voorkamer, even though Willem Prinsloo had come to town from his farm at Abjaterskop with a cask of peach brandy for the sports bar clientele.Willem Prinsloo is known throughout the Groot Marico for his mampoer and it makes a nice change from the usual Castle Lager, especially to dull the senses when the Springboks are playing, said Gysbert van Tonder.Oupa Bekker, who claimed to have once seen Benny Osler play, said that considering the state of his Afrikaner cattle and the prospects for his mealie crop, he didn't know whether to pray for rain or the Springboks. "The Springboks," they all said in unison.But, said Oupa Bekker, he enjoyed the people in the TV studio talking about the match more than the match itself. The way they talked, said Oupa Bekker, you would have thought the Springboks could beat anyone.At Naude said he couldn't agree or disagree with Nick Mallett because the man spoke too fast and too English."He explains rugby like it was a difficult mathematics problem," said At Naude. "When he stops speaking I am still mystified."Gysbert van Tonder said that it was just as well the rugby had to end. If they had allowed Naas Botha to carry on, he would be like that predikant in Bekkersdal."Dominee Welthagen once went into a trance while we were singing Psalm 119, which has, as you know, 176 verses," said Gysbert van Tonder. "We sang the blerrie lot, and it was dark by the time we got to the last verse."Jurie Steyn wanted to know why Gysbert van Tonder had brought up the Bekkersdal dominee again."If they had let Naas carry on," said Gysbert van Tonder, "by the time he had finished, it would have been time to switch over to the cricket in Australia."Johnny Koen said the manne in the TV studio always seemed to have watched a different game from the one he had just seen."Take this matter of 'pillar defence' they are now talking about," he said. "The only pillars I know are like Lot's wife, they're motionless and thick."Oupa Bekker interjected to say that Johnny Koen had summed up the Springboks better than any of those people in the TV studio.
