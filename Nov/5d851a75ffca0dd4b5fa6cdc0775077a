Warrant Officer Dirk Greeff even thanked advocate Terry Price SC when he was accused of having a selective memory. I can assure you that is not a compliment an annoyed Price responded.Price had criticised Greeff for only recording select details in his pocket book and leaving out important aspects such as when Siyoni 37 enquired about his right to an attorney.Taking the stand later on Wednesday morning a Queenstown policeman who then took down Siyoni s confession with regards to his alleged involvement in Jayde Panayiotou s murder said the alleged middleman was determined to tell the truth .Captain Ntembiso Ndzenzevu told state advocate Marius Stander that he was contacted by the head of detectives in the Eastern Cape Brigadier Gary McLaren to meet a suspect in Fort Beaufort on April 28 last year in order to record his version of events.Ndzenzevu who has 29 years experience in the SA Police Service said he was not privy to the details of the murder investigation and had explained to Siyoni that he was not compelled to give a statement.Told by Stander that Siyoni had since backtracked on what was written in the statement Ndzenzevu said: Everything recorded there is what he told me. Siyoni allegedly claimed at the time that he was hired by Jayde s husband Christopher Panayiotou 30 to recruit hitmen to kidnap and kill the Uitenhage teacher on April 21 last year.Ndzenzevu returns to the stand on Wednesday afternoon for cross-examination.TMG Digital/The Herald
