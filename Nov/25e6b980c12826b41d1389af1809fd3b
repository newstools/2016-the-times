"As the NPA we welcome that court's decision and we believe that we were given a fair chance to respond as the respondent in the matter and we therefore accept the ruling " said NPA's spokesperson Phindi Louw on Wednesday.She was speaking to TMG Digital outside Court 13 where Fees Must Fall leader Dlamini was granted R2000 bail after spending three weeks in custody.Louw rubbished claims that Dlamini's arrest was part of a political conspiracy as claimed by the student leader's legal representatives Advocate Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi on Tuesday."One thing we need to correct as the NPA is the insinuation made yesterday that the prosecution in this matter was politically motivated. That is completely incorrect and as the NPA we want to clearly state that all prosecutorial decisions of the NPA are based on merits and facts surrounding any case " Louw said.On Tuesday Mpofu argued in court that after a meeting on October 10 between the Minister of Justice Michael Masutha National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams as well as President Jacob Zuma at the African National Congress headquarters Luthuli House Dlamini and other student leaders were targeted and arrested.Mpofu said "This case my lord has got broader social and political connotations because it happened in the context of student protests at the University of Witwatersrand under the so called Fees Must Fall campaign".The student leader was arrested on October 15 and was denied bail by the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on 19 October.Magistrate Albertus Roux had said that releasing Dlamini on bail would not be in the best interest of justice because the evidence before the court proves that he won t be able to maintain peaceful protests.His next court appearance is 15 November.- TMG Digital
