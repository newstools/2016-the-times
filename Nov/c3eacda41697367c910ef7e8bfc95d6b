Posting a message about not giving up and ensuring that your haters don't get you down, Norma spread another NB message on her Instagram account."As you take your fist step in your journey to success or halfway towards it ...I want to encourage you to remain focus at all times, we all know that success doesn't come easy . As you keep on climbing higher sometimes you will face rejection and disappointments but don't lose your focus.At times you will have haters,lack of support, and cross paths with those who just waiting to see you fail or those who completely swear they know everything, but truly don't have a clue of what it even takes to do what you are doing.It's human nature that some people are waiting to see you fail,or say "I told you so" or see you make one mistake and jump all over that versus commend all your small wins, but unfortunately it's part of life , as hard as it may seem, you must respect that and keep going.Stay focused, get your mind right,foresee it coming , whoever' trying to take you down, let them eat your dust. Never let anyone stand in your way.Sometimes it will get into you because you are human but keep standing and know you have more power because it's only you knows where you are going and your enemy relies on your steps. No matter what life throws at you , even being betrayed by people you trusted , you remain focused. "Slay!
