The bigger field lends a stronger international flavour to the event and it was reflected in the fact that Chile's Felipe Aguilar South Korea's Jeunghun Wang and the Brit Ross Fisher are out front at four-under.They had one bogey each on a challenging day at the Gary Player Country Club where players had to contend with a swirling breeze.In Fisher's case he believes it could have been worse when he had his bogey on the 17th. I salvaged bogey. But I made birdie on the next hole after letting a few slip on the back nine."I gave myself a chance with my approach and had a long look before I sunk the putt. 68 is a great start he enthused.Fisher knows his way around this lay-out. He believes it hands him a slight advantage. The more you play this course the more you understand how to play it. There are times you can be aggressive and there are times when you need to be strategic. At the same time around here you know when you walk up to the ninth and you see all those scores you know you need to shoot low to have a chance. You also have to be quite strategic but I like to be aggressive around here. I used the driver quite a bit. I try and give myself a good look at birdies and attack the par fives. I wasn't that good with the driver today but never got myself into too much trouble. You can miss the fairway by about five to eight yards and you'll be okay. Any wider than that and the rough is really penal. It is like that around the greens as well.Five yards off you can get some really brutal lies.One shot back lurks 2008 champion Henrik Stenson Jaco van Zyl George Coetzee Chris Wood Alexander Noren Victor Dubuisson and Richie Ramsay. - TMG Digital
