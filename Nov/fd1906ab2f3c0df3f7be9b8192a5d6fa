Eymael told Times Media that with City not playing again until they meet Bloemfontein Celtic away on November 20 after the Fifa international date he has returned to Belgium for a brief break to visit his family.He denied reports that he might be about to leave City because of unhappiness over management decisions. I just arrived in Belgium this [Thursday] morning at 6.30am. I came home to see my family because it's difficult not to be home for five months Eymael said. I m leaving Belgium on Sunday night and will arrive back in South Africa on Monday. If I wanted to leave [the club] I would have told my chairman first then my players and then the media. I wouldn t do it the other way around.
