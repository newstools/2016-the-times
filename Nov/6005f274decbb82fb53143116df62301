Deputy Public Protector Kevin Malunga conducted an inspection of the 250m sandy stretch near Mpenjathi Nature Reserve yesterday to gather facts about the proposed nudist beach.The inspection was attended by naturists, traditional leaders and members of the Concerned Citizens Group, who approached the public ombudsman to complain that the application to declare the nudist beach legal was not dealt with adequately.Traditional leaders were concerned that the beach would interfere with ancestral graves and said 75% of the community was against a nudist beach in the area.A 500m stretch of the beach in the Mpenjathi Nature Reserve was given official nude beach status by the Hibiscus Coast municipality in 2014, but due to opposition the plan has been put on hold.There is currently a ban on anyone swimming nude on the beach.Malunga said the purpose of the inspection was to establish how secluded the beach was, and if the nudism would pose a threat to children or the community in any way."One of the motivations made by the naturists is that the place is secluded, so we wanted to see that because it is raising a lot of interest, because people think the nudist beach is up and running."And there are the amakhosi, who have raised the issue of ancestral graves in the precinct. The report will contain our remedial action in this particular issue."Local chief Bhekizizwe Nzimak we said some of the nudists had been seen wandering in the vicinity of the beach."The last time we were here we saw six-year-olds going towards the beach and that's one of our concerns. Another concern is that there are our ancestral graves here and 75% of our communities are opposed to the nude beach," Nzimakwe said.The graves are along a path leading to the beach.Pastor Mike Effanga, who claims to represent 30 churches and thousands of church members in towns along the South Coast, said it was misleading to say that children would not be exposed to nudists.Malunga said the report was expected early next year.
