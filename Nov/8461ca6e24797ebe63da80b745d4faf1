His lawyer, Shaheed Dollie, said Saloojee signed a settlement agreement but would not say how much he was paid.He was suspended last year after Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown appointed a new board, which accused him of causing a cash crunch for Denel by shortening the terms of a R455-million bank loan used to buy BAE Land Systems.Saloojee said it was a trumped-up charge to oust him to make way for a deal with the Guptas that he would not have approved.The only member of the old board retained by Brown was Johannes "Sparks" Motseki, who once described himself as a close friend of President Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane. He has business ties with the Guptas.Shortly after Saloojee's removal Denel approved a controversial deal with Gupta-owned company VR Laser's Hong Kong subsidiary VR Laser Asia, which is owned by close Gupta associate Salim Essa.Saloojee said the accusations were unfounded because the loan to buy BAE Land Systems had been intended as bridging finance until an equity partner was found, but the new board cancelled the deal.
