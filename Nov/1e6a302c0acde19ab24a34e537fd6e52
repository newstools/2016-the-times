BLF on Wednesday laid charges at the Hillbrow Police Station against Manuel Rupert and 15 other high profile officials and businesspeople accusing them of stealing R26 billion from the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb). Manuel who is the deputy chairman at financial advisory group Rothschild said on Thursday that the movement's claims probably lack substance."I opt not to respond to irrational rantings of people such as [BLF leader] Mr [Andile] Mgxitama or his collaborators. There has been nothing of substance from any of them. This instance cannot be different " he said.BLF national deputy coordinator Tshidiso Tsimong confirmed that the case had been opened on Wednesday.BLF alleges that Rupert and other "white capitalists stole from the people" when money was siphoned from state coffers through various schemes towards the end of Apartheid.The allegations first came to light when UK-based investigation and asset recovery firm Ciex produced a report naming Absa Nedbank Sanlam and Remgro of which Rupert is non-executive chair and other companies.The report detailed the alleged misuse of government funds by the apartheid government and made recommendations on how the money should be recovered.Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela was investigating the conduct of former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Nelson Mandela following the Ciex report's release. The report has not yet been released.Tsimong said Manuel Mbeki and former Sarb governor Tito Mboweni are among those facing charges including theft fraud and embezzlement."[They did not steal] but they knew about this case and they did nothing about it. That is why we have implicated them in the matter."Tsimong urged the men to cooperate with the law and testify in a trial.BLF said in a statement it had evidence to turn over to authorities.Mbeki Rupert and Mboweni have been approached for comment.- TMG Digital
