The organisation was commenting on a Sunday Times report which detailed a series of attacks and death threats on three of the SABC 8: Suna Venter Foeta Krige and Busisiwe Ntuli.The list includes an incident in which Venter's car came under fire in a late-night shooting a separate incident where her brake cables were cut a series of house break-ins and threats sent via SMS demanding that the journalists drop their court case against the SABC or risk death.The Sunday Times reported that some of these messages may have been sent from the Auckland Park area.The journalists were suspended by the SABC for opposing its ban on broadcasts of violent protests in which state property was destroyed. Seven of the eight were reinstated after they challenged their dismissals in the Labour Court in Johannesburg.Right2Know commended the SABC 8 for refusing to back down in the face of death threats bullets and intimidation. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the secret war being waged on members of the SABC 8 the group of public broadcaster workers who have blown the whistle on censorship and mismanagement at the SABC. The organisation said the fact that these attacks have specifically targeted the women of the SABC 8 was particularly disturbing.It also called on the police to double its investigation of these attacks and arrest the culprits.The organisation said to address the root causes of this intimidation Parliament must take swift action and dissolve the SABC Board.- TMG Digital
