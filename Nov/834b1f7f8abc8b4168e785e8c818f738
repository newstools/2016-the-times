The Springboks have managed just one win in their last six Tests and have only won four of 10 Tests in 2016. They are not in a rut as much as they are in a deep gorge.Habana 33 was named on the wing in place of old mate JP Pietersen for Saturday s clash against the Azzuri at the Artemio Franchi Stadium where he will win his 124th cap 12 years after making his debut. He is one of two changes to the side that lost 37-21 to England last week with flank Nizaam Carr making his first start in place if the injured Eben Etzebeth with Pieter-Steph du Toit shifting from flank. I ve played against Italy twice in Italy and not only do they get fired up before the game they bring intensity in the game too Habana cautioned. We understand this is the biggest game of our season given the year we ve had. We have to show improvement in all areas on Saturday. We have a lot respect for them especially with a guy like [SA coach] Brendan Venter giving them input. We have to play rugby for 80 minutes. Carr who made his first Test appearance in more than a year when he came off the bench against England last week has been tasked with openside flank duties. He also recognised that the Boks need to take a step up after a season of disappointment. I fully believe that we as Boks can turn around what has been a tough season Carr said. I trust every single player the coaches and the plan and it s just up to us as players to cut out the silly errors. We have been good in the first 20 to 30 minutes but then the concentration seems to go. So we have to stick to that for the whole game. I ve been blessed to be able to able to play No 8 and No 6 although I prefer eighthman. Warren Whiteley has been doing a great job and with Willem at No 7 it gives us more balance. I have to adapt my game because I can t be standing out wide and playing that linking game I do as a No 8. I need to be at the breakdown first because Italy will look to make those leg tackles and get a stealer in over the ball. I have to get stuck in and make a few turnovers. The nice thing though is that all players will go for the ball when the opportunity is there.
