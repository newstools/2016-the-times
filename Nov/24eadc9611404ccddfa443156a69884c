Everite Chauke was swept away when she slipped from her father Shadrick's grip as he scaled a tree to escape the rushing water.Her father Shadrick had gone to the Hillbrow Government Mortuary to identify the body on Wednesday morning but police said this impossible due to its badly decomposed state.Police spokesman Kay Makhubele said DNA samples from the body and the father were taken to a laboratory to determine if they are a match. The parents could not be allowed to see the baby the way it is. What happened is that all the swabs were taken and are now taken to forensics Makhubele said.Makhubele could not be drawn on how long it would take for the results to be ready but said a speedy response should be expected.He also said the family had been prepared at a counselling session on Tuesday to expect the worse.The family left the mortuary in a sombre mood with father Shadrick avoiding the media.The flash floods affected large parts of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni two weeks ago.
