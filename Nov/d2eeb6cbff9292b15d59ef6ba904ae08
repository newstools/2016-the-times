If they bring rain - as forecast to do tomorrow and on Sunday and Monday - there will be no wickets.But if the rain stays away the clouds should help the ball swing. Hello wickets.Then again, clouds mean more moisture even if the heavens stay closed. Goodbye reverse swing.And that's bad news for South Africa, whose mastery of one of cricket's less obvious, more subtle skills was a significant factor in winning the first Test.Despite being dismissed for 242 in their first innings, losing Dale Steyn to a broken shoulder after he had bowled only 12.4 overs in Australia's reply, in which they conceded 166 runs before they took a wicket, the visitors found ways to earn one of the most dramatic victories in Test history. Among those ways was reverse swing.
