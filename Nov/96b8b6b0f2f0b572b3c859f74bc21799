Langerman who picked up a hamstring injury in training on Tuesday and defensive midfielder Dean Furman (ribcage) have been released from the squad for the crucial Russia 2018 showdown at Peter Mokaba Stadium (3pm).Langerman s Mamelodi Sundowns teammate Tiyani Mabunda has already joined the Bafana squad as a replacement for Furman. At left-back Bafana s team management have been left scratching their heads at who can back up Orlando Pirates Matlaba.Among the candidates the first-choice Bidvest Wits Sifiso Hlanti is injured.As are Sibusiso Khumalo at Kaizer Chiefs and Marc van Heerden at Chippa United while Pirates Patrick Phungwayo has played just one match this season and was barely fielded in the second half of last season. Phungwayo and SuperSport United winger Maphosa Modiba who can play left-back would appear to be the leading candidates.- TMG Digital
