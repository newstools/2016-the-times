The DA yesterday asked why Motsoeneng's position, and that of the corporation's COO, which Motsoeneng previously held, were filled without being advertised.Bessie Tugwana was appointed to the COO post.Responding to a written question by DA MP Phumzile van Damme, Muthambi said the positions had not been advertised.Her response was made a day after the parliamentary ad hoc committee set up to investigate the SABC met for the first time. Muthambi will testify in the inquiry."The positions of group executive of corporate affairs and chief operating officer were not advertised. There was no need to advertise the position of COO as Ms Tugwana is acting in this position. Mr Motsoeneng was reinstated to the position he occupied prior to his appointment as the COO," said Muthambi.SABC board faces Parliament grilling over Hlaudi s new jobVan Damme said Muthambi's response lent credence "to the perception that the position [of COO] is being kept for Mr Motsoeneng. The position of SABC CEO was advertised on October 2 2016. Why has the COO position not been advertised?" asked Van Damme.Muthambi's spokesman, Ayanda Holo, said yesterday that Motsoeneng had always been a permanent employee of the SABC."Hlaudi is a stakeholder person, he then goes for a position higher and as a stakeholder he's a permanent employee. They think they have that position, but the judge says: 'No, you don't have that position.' So where does he go back to? To his original position."
