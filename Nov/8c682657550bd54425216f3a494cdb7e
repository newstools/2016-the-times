The final field for Joburg's premier horse race will be announced next week and it's no foregone conclusion which entrants will get the nod. That makes the Grade 2 Victory Moon a fiercely contested business.And it won't be simply a no-hoper slot in the big one. Several of the highest-rated entries for the Summer Cup have already been scratched, and while this takes a bit of gloss off the race it certainly opens winning chances for all among the next rank.Johan Janse van Vuuren, the trainer who's taking the Highveld spring season by storm, doesn't have a runner in tomorrow's 1800m event. This might make it harder for the punter who would automatically plump for the young titan, but there are audible sighs of relief from racing stables around the city; at least someone else gets a chance at a trophy.Even national champion trainer Sean Tarry might get a look-in this time. He saddles the promising young horse Liege and the granddaddy of the turf, Halve The Deficit.The former is the clear preference, with stable jockey S'manga Khumalo on board and a form line that suggests he is fighting fit and pawing the turf for a shot at a really big prize.Eight-year-old Halve The Deficit, while at much longer odds, is just the sort of moody old codger who is wont to fly up and kick mud in our eyes.But racing is still a "democratic" pursuit and a clutch of "smaller" trainers - Brian Wiid, Candice Dawson and Tyrone Zackey - will all be saddling decent sorts that have the talent to snare the spoils.Zackey has made a point of targeting the Victory Moon in the last few years, as a launch pad, not only for the Highveld season but the winter season on the east coast.His Smanjemanje won it and went on to nearly pull off a mega-shock in the Durban July. His candidate tomorrow, Judicial, won the race in 2014 and could quite easily do it again.Wiid's Bankable Teddy never runs a bad race and just needs a bit of luck in running to break through into the top league.Prince Of Orange has blossomed in Dawson's care and looks quite capable of snatching a race of this magnitude.Mike Azzie is certainly no small trainer and the ebullient, charming big guy sends out no fewer than four hopefuls. Arctica looks the most likely winner among them.Geoff Woodruff is holding form rather well and his runners - Master Switch and Master 'N Commander - warrant being included in every betting combination.The bottom line is that the job of finding the winner is hard. Trifectas and Quartets are the order of the day, as is going wide in the exotics.
