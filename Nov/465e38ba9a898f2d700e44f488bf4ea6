But that didn t quieten his detractors.Instead Du Plessis who was fined 100% of his match fee on Tuesday for ball-tampering during the second test in Hobart was roundly booed when he stepped over the boundary to begin his innings.The din diminished when Du Plessis reached 50 and when he celebrated his century there was but a smattering of the earlier anger amid the waves of applause.Du Plessis unbeaten 118 was almost half of South Africa s first innings of 259/9 declared.Australia eked out 14 runs without loss in the 12 overs they faced before the close.South Africa who have already won the series lost three wickets for 89 in the first session and 4/76 between tea and dinner on their first day of pink-ball day/night test cricket.Du Plessis came to the crease when they were 44/3 and saw them shamble to 117/5.He batted through seven partnerships including stands of 51 with Stephen Cook 54 with Kyle Abbott and an unbroken 39 with debutant Tabraiz Shamsi.Cook used an early reprieve to make 40 his best effort in nine innings across all formats and at all levels and only the second time in those trips to the crease that he has reached 20.When he was four not out Cook was given out lbw to Mitchell Starc with the 18th ball of the match. Replays showed Starc had overstepped.But the visitors slumped to 44/3 in the first hour with Dean Elgar Hashim Amla and JP Duminy all back in the hut.Elgar edged Starc to third slip in the seventh over while Josh Hazlewood had Amla caught at first slip and Duminy taken by wicketkeeper Matthew Wade.Hazlewood has dismissed Amla in all of his four innings in the series but his delivery to remove Duminy came close to being ruled a no-ball.Duminy s demise brought Du Plessis to the crease and he shared 51 with Cook before the latter was caught at second slip off Starc.Jackson Bird playing his first test since February had Temba Bavuma caught behind.Quinton de Kock scored 24 before falling in similar fashion to Hazlewood.Hazlewood struck the last blow of the second session by finding the thinnest of edges of Vernon Philander s bat for another catch by Wade.Du Plessis and Abbott held up Australia s progress for 15 overs before Abbott was trapped in front by Bird for 17.Kagiso Rabada ended Nathan Lyon s drought of 660 legal deliveries in first-class cricket without a wicket when the off-spinner had him smartly stumped by Wade.Enter Shamsi and with him 35 balls of haphazard hitting - at least by the debutant - before Du Plessis drilled Starc through the covers for four and declared.Hazlewood finished with 4/68. - TMG Digital
