Speaking at the Discovery Leadership Summit in Sandton on Monday Beckham looked back to May 2003 when he came to SA with the England national team to play a friendly international against Bafana Bafana at Kings Park Rugby Stadium.The game was used to raise the profile of SA's bid to host the 2010 World Cup and both sets of players visited Mandela in Houghton.The Englishman who was his country's captain at the time said he cringes when he sees photographs of himself spotting the infamous cornrows."I've got pictures of myself and Nelson Mandela in my home and he looks great " he said."But unfortunately I've got cornrows"The visitors won that friendly international 2-1 and it is mostly remembered for an injury Beckham suffered after a challenge from Thabang Molefe broke a bone in the England captain's thumb. - TMG Digital
