According to Sunday World, Vanessa Mgcina opened an assault case against Jub Jub, claiming that he had "strangled" her with "both hands" during an alleged altercation at the rapper's house in Naturena, Johannesburg on December 2.However, the case of assault has been withdrawn. "After having a meeting with my family, I decided to go to the police station and withdraw the case. I was angry and emotional and blew the whole thing out of proportion," Vanessa apparently told the paper. Speaking to the local publication Jub Jub's manager said the family were left shocked by the claims but were happy the charges were withdrawn. Despite the charges being withdrawn against Jub Jub, the Department of Correctional Services have reportedly launched its own investigation into the matter. "It is worth mentioning that (the department) takes this matter seriously and harsh measures will be taken against any offender who breaks the law or violates parole conditions," the department's spokesperson, Singabakho Nxumalo, told the paper. Jub Jub and his friend, Themba Tshabalala were convicted in 2012 for crashing their cars into a group of school children in 2010. The accident left four boys dead and two others seriously injured.It has been widely reported that the disgraced musician, who has served half of his eight-year jail sentence is eligible for parole early next year.
