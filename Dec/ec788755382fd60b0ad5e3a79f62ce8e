The party noted that Zuma s legal team had filed papers at the North Gauteng High Court on Friday asking the court to review and set aside remedial actions contained in the State of Capture report in particular the recommendation to establish a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into the matter calling it unconstitutional . As the original complainant in this case as well as being listed in Zuma s papers as a respondent we look forward to opposing this application DA leader Mmusi Maimane said on Sunday.Maimane said that with the electorate as well as large portions of his own party rejecting him this was a desperate move by Jacob Zuma to delay the inevitable the last kicks of a dying horse . I have already laid criminal charges last month against President Jacob Zuma and his band of cronies for their role in aiding promoting and benefiting from the corrosive project of State Capture in South Africa. In a meeting with the Head of the Serious Commercial Crimes Unit last week it was confirmed to me that the Hawks will be investigating these charges. The DA will make sure Jacob Zuma and all those who aid and abet him are held accountable for their flagrant abuse of power to make themselves rich at the expense of the poor and the jobless Maimane added.
