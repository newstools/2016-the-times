Tira, who was held up by thugs in an attempt to steal his cellphone, said that he was protected by God and his ancestors during the mugging. Tira explained toTshisaLIVE that he was walking back to his car after a show in Johannesburg this past weekend, when he was confronted by ten men, who tried to steal his phone. He fought them off until security guards were alerted to the incident. "I had to use violence and fight them off. Many of them ran away before the security came and helped me back to my car," Tira said.Tira later took to Facebook to share a picture of a deep cut he received to his arm while fighting off the thugs. Tira told us that he believed the ancestors and God watched over him during the encounter."The ancestors and God are always there to protect and look after me. I am healing and doing better now," he said.
