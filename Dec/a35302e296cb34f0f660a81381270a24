Amakhosi took to their Twitter account to announce the deal - a two-and-a-half year contract that will see the player at Naturena until June 2019.Chiefs have been linked with the 28-year-old winger or playmaker for more than a year.Molangoane trained with Chiefs during the off-season and was on the verge of putting pen to paper to complete a move to the Naturena side but a deal seemed to have fallen through as Chippa contested they still had a contract with the player.The speedy skilful former Platinum Stars forward had also tried to force a move to Chiefs by reporting Chippa to the PSL's Dispute Resolution Chamber.But he failed to get his clearance from Chilli Boys as the Dispute Resolution Chamber ruled against him.Chiefs next Absa Premiership match will be away at Molangoane's former club Chippa at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Wednesday as Steve Komphela's charges will look to snap a win-less run of seven matches.We would like to confirm the signing of Joseph Molangoane from Chippa United till 30 June 2019.
