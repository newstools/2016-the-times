The national executive committee of the ANC agreed last month that the first two days of its national policy conference should be converted into a national consultative conference sought by the veterans to discuss leadership challenges and other problems facing the governing party.However the veterans want the consultative conference to happen way before the policy indaba so that its recommendations could be discussed and ultimately adopted as ANC policy.ANC veteran Barbara Masekela argued that two days allocated at the beginning of the policy conference would not be enough to thrash out the concerns raised in their document For the Sake of our Future. These concerns include:- The ANC leadership pre-occupying itself with personal interests at the expense of the country especially the poor- Failure to act decisively against corruption nepotism factional and arrogance- Placing the ANC in the National Assembly as well as Parliament in a position to act against the Constitution and- Confirmed the perception by members and supporters of the ANC that the leadership has failed to show leadership among others.Another ANC stalwart Wally Serote said it was important for there to be a distinction between the consultative and policy conferences. There has to be a distance between the national policy conference and the national consultative conference because the consultative conference will deal with issues [raised by the veterans]. The key issue is that the veterans have taken a decision that there must be this space he said.The veterans said they would establish a preparatory committee that would take the matter to the ANC and work on preparations for the consultative conference once there s final agreement on the matter.In another twist the stalwarts and veterans want the consultative conference not to be confined to ANC members only.Explaining the rationale for this request former Minister of Provincial and Local Government Sydney Mufamadi said: A National Consultative Conference is occasioned by the crisis the ANC is in which does not only affect the ANC. You will understand that what affects the ANC affects everyone else. We are not intending to correct what is happening in the ANC for the ANC s sake only but for the country as well. - TMG Digital/The Times
