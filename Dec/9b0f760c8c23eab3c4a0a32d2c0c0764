National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) spokesman Craig Lambinon said the institute s Port Elizabeth station was asked by Air Traffic Control to investigate the sighting of an unidentified flying object at about 9.30pm. A Boeing 737 cargo aircraft captain and co-pilot flying from Cape Town International Airport to Port Elizabeth International Airport reported seeing what appeared to be a green object increasing in altitude past the cockpit of their aeroplane reaching to about 1000 feet into clouds above them and then returning towards earth at high speed past the cockpit of the aeroplane he said.The sighting was reported to Air Traffic Control in Port Elizabeth where officials asked the NSRI to investigate the possibility that an aircraft or craft in difficulty.The incident occurred about 10 nautical miles off-shore of Jeffreys Bay and about 1 000m in the sky.Officials soon dismissed initial suggestions that it was a 300m green parachute flare as these flares cannot reach that height. NSRI Jeffreys Bay were alerted and although the matter was monitored throughout the night the green object has not been seen since and there are no reports of anyone or craft or aircraft overdue or missing Lambinon said. No further reports of sightings have been received and the incident remains a mystery. TMG Digital/The Herald
