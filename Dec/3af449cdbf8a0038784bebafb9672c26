Zuma said the church should stop "meddling" in politics.He was speaking to thousands of Twelve Apostles' Church in Christ members at their International Thanksgiving Day celebrations, at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban yesterday.Following a sermon by Chief Apostle Caesar Nongqunga, Zuma wasted no time in putting the church in its place."It is sad to see the church and church leaders getting mired in matters of politics instead of praying for leaders."I urge the church to pray for us as leaders; pray for our people to stop the hatred. I urge you to assist us to build a stable nation built on love," said Zuma.Leaders of the SA Council of Churches and vocal supporters of the Save SA campaign. such as Frank Chikane, Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana and Chief Rabbi Warren Goldstein, have been unequivocal in their calls for Zuma to quit as head of state.Similar calls have been made by retired Anglican archb ishop Desmond Tutu and Anglican Bishop Thabo Makgoba.Nongqunga portrayed Zuma as a victim and said he should be "forgiven for all his transgressions"."If the president was really corrupt would he still be here among us?" asked Nongqunga during his hour-long sermon, which was punctuated by rapturous applause. That remark won a smile from Zuma, who until then had been stony-faced."Set him free. What has he done that anyone else hasn't done? Is paying off your debt a crime?" Nongqunga asked, referring to reports that Zuma had secured a R7.8-million bank loan to pay off his Nkandla debt to the state."Before you judge him, remember what others before him have done," said Nongqunga.
