Stars held Downs to 1-1 in a first half of Saturday's Premier League game played in killing heat where Khama Billiat s 41st-minute opener was cancelled out by Thozani Sekotlong in the 43rd.Strikes in the 58th and 59th by Percy Tau and Keagan Dolly then Tau again in the 79th continued Downs recent record of pastings of Stars before this game the last three league and cup results were 6-1 3-1 and 5-2 making it 18 goals in four games.Ahead of Downs departure on Monday for the Club World Cup in Japan coach Pitso Mosimane was without recent injury scares Sibusiso Vilakazi and Anthony Laffor while pressing other key performers back into action.Dolly and Billiat were back from shin splint injuries and Leonardo Castro made his first start reuniting the famous CBD front combination for the first time in a starting line-up since July in the Champions League.Stars coach Giovanni Solinas has introduced a number of young players for the resource-challenged Free State team and brought back a notable resilience though a lack of depth in Stars squad is their concern.Of course it was Sundowns who pushed at Stars three-man centreback and two wing-back defence for much of the first half Ea Lla Kotlo mostly containing one of Africa s fiercest club attacks quite well.From an early corner Wayne Arendse headed over then Billiat had a solid drive at goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni.In the 35th Dolly initiated an attack from his own half on the left and after a short-passing combination on the edge of the area involving Castro and Billiat was through down the middle to force a save from Ngobeni.If that move suggested that the CBD was back then after Bokang Tlhone s header from a corner looped onto the crossbar for Stars Downs opener confirmed it.Billiat put Castro through into the box down the left who smartly squared back to Billiat in space the Zimbabwean slotting calmly past Ngobeni.But this Stars side under Solinas are known for their fight. Two minutes later the impressive left wing-back Tlhone skipped down the left and past the attempted challenge of Wayne Arendse freeing Sekotlong on the left of the box to curl a fine finish past Denis Onyango.This was not quite the script Downs wanted. But if it was a display in class the Brazilians were looking for ahead of a tournament against world stars they provided it early in the second half.When Sundowns turn it on one can run out of superlatives to describe the sheer sexiness of it.Billiat s backheel put Langerman into space on the left to cross for Tau who seemed to hang in the air for the length of a flight to Japan before a classy headed connection past Ngobeni.Dolly played two one-twos with Billiat and then Castro to go through and slam in a third.Tau practically jogged in a fourth beating Langelihle Ndlovu on the left and advancing unchecked to finish past Ngobeni.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
