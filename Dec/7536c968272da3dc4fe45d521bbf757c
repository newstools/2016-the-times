The International Cricket Council will hear Du Plessis' case on Monday.A week later he is due to lead South Africa in the first test against Sri Lanka at St George's Park.But if Du Plessis is smacked with four demerit points - which is an option for judicial commissioner Michael Beloff - he will be banned for the first Test.Should that make Du Plessis reconsider his appeal?"It sounds like the logical thing to do," he said at Newlands yesterday."But I didn't agree with the whole way it happened and unfolded, even the hearing that took place and how everything works when it comes to those hearings."Even if it meant that it was a decision that came out in a way I didn't want it to, for me it's the principle of standing up to something that you don't agree with."And that's what a captain is all about. It's making sure you stand your ground and fight for whatever the cause is."The cause in this case is that Du Plessis disputes that using fingers from his mouth in which a mint is, on footage, visible to help the ball preserve its shine makes him guilty of tampering.
