Definitely out is talismanic captain and top-scorer Lebogang Manyama who is suspended along with Austrian midfielder Roland Putsche a player who has grown in influence over the past few weeks.The versatile Mpho Matsi also picked up a nasty head injury in the 1-1 draw with SuperSport United on Friday evening and is a doubt along with impressive forward Sibusiso Masina and experienced defender Robyn Johannes. Lebogang Manyama and Roland Putsche are out with suspension " Tinkler revealed."We need to see how [Mpho] Matsi is with a head injury [Sibusiso Masina] has a bit of a knock and was struggling [against SuperSport]. Robynn [Johannes] and quite a few other guys are feeling the affects so its important now how we rest them. City needed a last-gasp equaliser from Manyama to secure a point against SuperSport that kept them top of the table and Tinkler knows a victory will keep them there through the festive season break.They were handsome 4-1 winners over Stars in a home Telkom Knockout semifinal last month but meeting Ea Lla Koto away in Bethlehem is an altogether different proposition.While they won t quite be riding into town on a donkey Tinkler says it is a complicated place for his side to get to. It s another tough trip it s always difficult to go to the Free State particularly from Cape Town as we have to go via Jo burg but we are in a good space now the coach said. The result [against SuperSport United] was important for us the disappointment of not getting a result against Platinum [Stars] is obviously in the back of my mind."It s important for us to go there and try and get a point but that will be a difficult task. Struggling Stars have not lost at home since the end of September with three wins and two draws in that run. - TMG Digital
