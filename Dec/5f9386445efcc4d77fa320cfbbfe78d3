Highlands started the match on a blistering pace and were rewarded as early as the 12th minute when Lindokuhle Mbatha beat the off side trap and tucked away a neat finish to put the home side ahead at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa.Second half substitute Grant Margeman equalised for the Urban Warriors eight minutes after the restart but keeper Kapini stole the show in emphatic fashion three minutes later as the Lions of the North halted their eight-match winless streak.With the scoreline tied at 1-1, Ajax midfielder Bantu Mzwakali found himself one-on-one with Kapini.The Highlands keeper thwarted the attack on the edge of his own box with a sliding clearance that went all the way and embarrassingly beat his opposite number Jody February from about 90 yards out.Highlands were the better side for the majority of the 90 minutes and should have won by a huge margin had they converted the avalanche of clear goal scoring opportunities that they created.The Zimbabwean keeper has surely endeared his name in the hearts of the Lions of the North supporters with his recent performancessKapini was a hero in Highlands' first match in the top flight in September as he saved two penalties in a 3-2 win over fellow PSL newcomers Baroka FC.It took the rookies 12 matches to record their second win, which sees them further climb up the table and move away from the relegation zone.Stanley Menzo's charges tried to salvage a result to no avail late in the second half and will return to Cape Town disappointed after their three-match winning streak came to a screeching halt.Highlands are in 14 place with 12 points after 13 matches while Ajax are also on 12 points but occupy 12 spot due to their superior goal difference over Igesund's charges.Other PSL midweek results:Tuesday 13 December 2016:Maritzburg United 2 1 Orlando PiratesCape Town City 0 4 Platinum StarsWednesday 14 December 2016:Highlands Park 2 1 Ajax Cape TownKaizer Chiefs 0 0 Bloemfontein CelticFree State Stars 1 0 Baroka FCPolokwane City 1 0 Chippa UnitedGolden Arrows 0 0 Bidvest Wits- TMG Digital
