 Implementing access control and security checkpoints at the National Key Point (NKP) but allowing strategic positions to be occupied by executives and senior managers who do not have security clearance is in itself a contravention of the National Key Point Act " said SANCO national spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu. Mahlangu said that interaction between the SABC Board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe and the parliamentary ad hoc committee conducting an inquiry into the SABC Board as well as Maguvhe's walkout together with other SABC executives his week had confirmed that the public broadcaster was not only on auto-pilot but have underscored the urgency need for the formal dissolution of its dysfunctional Board . "Every single day that passes without a proper governance structure executive management to oversee daily operations and implementation of critical as well as strategic decisions erodes public confidence and jeopardises the interests of the national asset " Mahlangu stressed. He said that the circus surrounding the SABC should come to an end. Stability has to be established for many good men and women in the corporation to continue with their patriotic duty of serving the nation without the current distraction Mahlangu added.
