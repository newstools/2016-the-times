The petition was launched by the South African Hindu Maha Sabha and other religious and cultural groups in Durban with the intention of achieving a public mandate to challenge the South African Broadcasting Corporation s policy of introducing a 90% local music content quota.Interested parties can go to the South African Hindu Maha Sabha website to sign the petition. It says that with the pay-off line Not everything is black and white the radio station emphasises both the South African and Indian identity of its listeners.Between May and October 2016 Lotus FM saw its average listener numbers fall by about 130 000 a third of its listeners - from 390 000 to 260 000 - and experience a huge decline in revenue.This was blamed mainly on the station playing local music that doesn't resonate with their listeners. Lotus FM describe itself as a metropolitan music and talk-focused Indian lifestyle station reflecting the music culture and lifestyle of the progressive South African Indian community.Ashwin Trikamjee president of the South African Hindu Maha Sabha and convenor of the Save Lotus FM committee said that although they knew that many Indian people were irked by the 90%-10% decision they did not expect such overwhelming support. The authoritarian imposition of the 90 percent local content on SABC radio stations has serious negative implications for minority groups especially for South Africans of Indian descent. This has had a devastating effect for Lotus FM.He said they want to use the petition to approach the Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi to reason with her to review the 90-10 decision. We are saying we are not against the promotion of local music per se. But we strongly feel that this must be introduced gradually to allow the local artist to produce and create local Indian music that will resonate with the listeners Trikamjee said.He added they have been in talks with the Department of Communications officials to secure a meeting with Muthambi somewhere in January .Muthambi's spokesman Ayanda Holo was not available for comment on Monday.Lotus FM officials declined to comment on the petition.
