This is according to the South African Human Rights Commission s (SAHRC s) report titled Global Goals for Every Child: Progress and disparities among children in South Africa which was launched on Wednesday in Johannesburg.The report illustrates the need for much to be done to ensure children's rights are realised."The mortality rate of children under five fell by 46% since 2005 but progress needs to accelerate to meet global and national targets."Most child and maternal deaths can be prevented as evidenced by the huge disparities between different provinces and population groups."For instance compared to with a white child a black child is almost more likely to die before he or she reaches his or her first birthday " the report says.According to the report an estimated 235 000 children under the age of 15 are living with HIV."Adolescent girls and young women are disproportionately vulnerable and at high risk."The report notes that the country is however making "important strides" in addressing the epidemic."New HIV infections among children are declining at an impressive rate largely due to the scaled-up efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission."While the prevalence of HIV among children is decreasing in all provinces the same cannot be said about KwaZulu-Natal the report reveals.The report also highlights a need to strengthen access to reproductive health information and care as the number of pregnant adolescent girls is on the rise."One in seven adolescent girls aged 15-19 have already given birth."Rates of adolescent pregnancy are especially high in both urban and rural informal areas and among girls from the poorest households.
