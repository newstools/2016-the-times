Bongani Khumalo who resigned from the board in 2015 after several run-ins with Communications Minister Faith Muthambi told the Parliamentary inquiry into the crisis at the public broadcaster that the issues at the corporation were not necessarily about the structure of the organisation but about attitudes and behaviour . I would like to call upon the relevant structures of Parliament to take responsibility for what has happened at the [SABC] said Khumalo.He suggested that MPs be more stringent when appointing board members and also offer them training especially in terms of corporate governance principles. The crisis at the SABC was also symptomatic of corporate governance issues that most state owned entities continue to grapple with said Khumalo.He told the inquiry that he resigned from the board in early 2015 after publicly challenging the board s controversial decision to back the appointment of Hlaudi Motsoeneng as permanent chief operating officer in 2014.Motsoeneng was appointed despite a damning report by the public protector that found that he had fabricated a matric qualification purged those he disagreed with and irregularly increased his salary from R1.5m to R2.4m in one year.Khumalo said that he had received a letter in late December 2014 from Muthambi asking him to provide reasons why she should not recommend to the President that he be dismissed from the board. Muthambi s legal adviser Dan Mantsha later told him the letter was sent to him in error. However Muthambi did not withdraw the letter and Khumalo said he consequently took the decision to resign.He said some of the board's functions were impacted by Muthambi s interference and there was a sense that Motsoeneng s appointment was manipulated .On Monday the High Court in Cape Town ruled that Motsoeneng was not entitled to occupy any position at SABC until the public protector s 2014 report is set aside or new disciplinary processes against him are finalised. The court said the initial disciplinary hearing that cleared Motsoeneng of any wrong doing was wholly inadequate .Madoda Shushu a former SABC head of procurement testified on Tuesday that under Motsoeneng maladministration irregular expenditure fraud and abuse of power became commonplace.He said procurement procedures were not followed and he was suspended in 2015 for raising grave concerns about transactions that were executed without his and the procurement division s involvement. Shushu has since resigned from the SABC.He said the controversial procurement of the rugby World Cup studio for R42.3m in 2015 did not follow due process and it was done without his knowledge. I questioned the process and informed them that I will not attach my signature on it said Shushu.The studio deal prompted a public outcry and an investigation by the National Treasury. Two other senior executives including former CEO Frans Matlala and five procurement and technology officials were suspended after they objected to studio deal.The executives were concerned that the deal never went to tender was not part of the approved capital expenditure plan procurement officials had not signed off on it no order was placed before equipment was delivered and payment terms were not in line with actual equipment installed.The Treasury investigation is said to have failed to take off after Matlala was suspended. He subsequently left the public broadcaster in 2016 after receiving a multi-million rand golden handshake.The inquiry continues on Tuesday with board chairman Mbulaheni Maguvhe scheduled to testify at 4pm.- TMG Digital/BusinessLive
