Malema was removed from the chamber after he refused to heed a request by the presiding officer to withdraw a statement referring to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa as a murderer .Malema had sought to have the removal which caused a major disruption to proceedings in the house overturned. He also wanted the court to declare Parliament s employment of ex police or military personnel in its security services unlawful which the court rejected.According to the office of the ANC Chief Whip the court found that the presiding officer had acted reasonably and concurred with Parliament that Malema s behaviour was disruptive and warranted his removal.The judge asserted: The Speaker in my view has shown beyond any doubt that there are instances of interference and disruption that judtify the removal of a member who hamstrings and incapacitates Parliament from conducting its business. Welcoming the ruling the office of the ANC Chief Whip said in a statement: We are pleased with the judgment as it affirms the National Assembly rules and the authority they grant the presiding officers to swiftly remove MPs whose conduct is disruptive or threatens to collapse the proceedings of the House. The judgment further affirms the Constitutional prerogative of Parliament to determine its own internal arrangements proceedings and procedures to govern its business.
