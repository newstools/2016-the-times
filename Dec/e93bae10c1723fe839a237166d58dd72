The TV and radio star topped the Twitter trends list on Friday after she posted a string of angry tweets aimed at her nemisis."Congratulations but you must stop lying. You don t have any manners that s the problem. I have been waiting for you. We are going to teach you a lesson. You're lying man, you like to tell lies. F*ck," she tweeted in Setswana.Twitter users quickly shared the spicy tweets and hilariously speculated who Bonang may have been referring to. But these tweets were quickly outnumbered by those who did not speak Setswana and were simply trying to figure out what she was saying. Naturally, Twitter couldn't help but poke fun at the situation. Soon, a language feud had started on the social media site.
