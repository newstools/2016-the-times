Celtic saw their winless run in the league extend to four matches after they were on the receiving end of a 3-0 thumping from Ajax Cape Town at home on Saturday.Siwelele caretaker coach Lehlohonolo Seema will be returning to Orlando stadium for the first time as a coach and he said on Monday he had his eye set on the three points that will be up for grabs."It will be good to go back to Orlando Stadium this time around not as a player but as an opposition coach sitting on the other bench " said the former Pirates defender."I will be the one that will be steering the team (on Tuesday). "There's no emotions and there is nothing to prove against Pirates."I only have good memories on that field and for the Orlando Pirates family."We are on the wrong side of the table."We are fighting for a point and every point to us it's like oxygen."Three points is what we need to give to our supporters so that they can have something to talk about during the holidays because the results have not been coming."We are going there to fight for points and Pirates are a big team."They are playing well and their attack in the league is very fearless."Celtic are 13th on the standings with 12 points from 13 games while Pirates are seventh with 18 points from 12 matches.The last time Celtic won a game was against Baroka FC in a 2-1 win at the Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein on November 24.Seema's charges took a point off Kaizer Chiefs after a goalless draw at Soccer City last week and will fancy their chances of at least escaping with a point against another Soweto team that hasn't fired on all cylinders this season. - TMG Digital
