"The national consultative conference needs to do in depth discussions about how we correct all the things that contributed to the things that the ANC finds itself [in] now. We therefore need time to do that and we can in our negotiations with the leadership of the ANC negotiate how we then partner with the national policy conference " said ANC veteran Wally Serote.He was speaking at a post internal workshop and meetings with the ANC national working committee in Parktown on Tuesday afternoon which a few members of the more than 101 veterans had attended.The anti-apartheid struggle veterans have previously argued that the policy conference will not adequately address their key concerns and therefore want a separate national consultative conference to be held in March instead of in June as part of the party s policy conference."The key issue here is that veterans have taken a decision that there must be this space which allows for the national consultative conference to exhaust all the issues that must be addressed."We also took a decision that while the national consultative conference will consist of ANC people we also have to consult with other structures [such] as other civil society and other secretarial structures in our country so that there is a comprehensive input into the way forward for the African National Congress " added Serote.Three weeks ago the ANC's national executive committee - the party's highest decision making body - resolved to set aside two days of the policy meeting to look at "organisational renewal" including previous discussions with the national working committee held in October.The veterans reiterated that a separate consultative conference is the only way for the party to reflect on its problems.Barbara Masekela an ANC veteran and businesswomen said the ANC needed "renewal" and as stalwarts the veterans needed to play a vital role in shaping the organisation s direction.
