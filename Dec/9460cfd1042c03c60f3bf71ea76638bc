That was the Red Berets response to ANCWL secretary-general Meokgo Matuba s attack on the opposition party leader s Julius Malema for his opinions on Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma s ambitions to be the next ANC president .Matuba had on Monday taken issue with Malema s reported assertion that President Jacob Zuma wants Nkosazana to be at the helm of leadership in the ANC is to portray Cde Nkosazana as nothing else but a person who is at the mercy of President Zuma with no capacity to lead .This she said reduces women to be living under the shadows of males and in dire need of blessings from males to ascend to positions of power and Matuba told Malema to butt out of the succession debate.Malema wouldn t be rising to the bait EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said on Tuesday night as he was on holiday.In a two-line statement Ndlozi said: The CIC Julius Malema is on a break this festive season enjoying his time with his family and the people of Seshego. Thus he will not be entertaining any media enquiries regarding the irrelevant ANCWL nonsensical utterances and neither will the EFF.
