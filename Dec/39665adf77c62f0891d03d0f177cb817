Lethebo Rabalago who has been dubbed the 'Prophet of Doom' caused widespread outrage, when a picture of him spraying members of his congregation with insecticide when viral. Speaking to TshisaLIVE on Friday, Mboro expressed his anger at pastor Lethebo, saying that the clergyman was treating people as insects."He is degrading human beings with harmful substances. He is poisoning his congregation and reducing people to insects. This is not the power of God. This is satanic. It is an attack on the black child and on Christianity," Mboro said.He accused Lethebo of seeking attention and warned that his actions might do more harm to the community."Children will see these things and think it is okay to spray each other in the eye with Doom. They will walk around hurting each other saying that it is in the name of God. This must stop," Mboro said.Mboro said that Lethebo's methods were "not a miracle" and were not benefiting his congregation, like Christianity is supposed to."If you are a prophet, you must perform miracles that will help others - not spray them like insects. I am not saying that he is not a prophet but the Bible says that 'you shall know them by their actions and their fruits,'" Mboro added.Mboro said that he had tried to visit Lethebo to speak to him, but members of the EFF had stormed the church moments before their meeting and the pastor had apparently "run away". "I tried to meet with him but I have now decided to not confront him about this. Instead I will pray for him. I have already started and I have about 200 other pastors who will help me cast out this evil spirit," Mboro said.
