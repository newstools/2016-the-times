Trump again lambasted the show "Saturday Night Live," on which he is played by actor Alec Baldwin.But whereas on other occasions Trump has tweeted his criticism the next morning, this time he fired away before the show ended."Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad," Trump wrote.In the latest sketch, Trump is gently chided by aides for sending retweets, one from a high school student, during a national security briefing.Actress Kate McKinnon's Kellyanne Conway, a Trump strategist, said the president-elect tweets a lot to "to distract the media from his business conflicts and all the very scary people in his cabinet."But Trump as played by Baldwin said, "actually that's not why I do it. I do it because my brain is bad."After Trump's tweet, Baldwin himself tweeted: "Release your tax returns and I'll stop. Ha."
