Having finished second behind Mark Boucher's side, the Warriors had to contest the semifinal, in which they saw off the Highveld Lions by way of spin-strangulation at a slow St George's Park.It is the Warriors' first T20 final since the 2010-2011 season, when they fell to the Cape Cobras at Newlands, where Kelly Smuts's valiant 32-ball 56 was not enough to get the Warriors over the line. Jon-Jon made 25 then, but has long since moved beyond that March night. But he knows the Titans will be a difficult proposition."We and the Titans have been the form sides in the competition and I think they would be feeling confident, too. I now know how to win in Pretoria and I think that gives us a bit of confidence."We were a bit unlucky on Sunday when we lost the five-over slog but Farhaan Behardien was sensational," Smuts said."It was the innings of his life and it was always going to be difficult to win a game when someone batted like he did, especially in a five over slog. At the end of the day, we actually got pretty close to beating them. It shows how well the teams have been playing and makes for a good contest on Friday."The thin Highveld air will suit the Warriors' ball strikers, who were also adept at batting on a slow surface. Christiaan Jonker's mature 30-ball 27 belied his aggressive nature, although the chase was buttressed by Colin Ingram.Smuts is hoping for a repeat of the collective performance of all bowlers chipping in."We're used to Jonker hitting the ball out of the ground but he rotated the strike very well and his experience showed."
