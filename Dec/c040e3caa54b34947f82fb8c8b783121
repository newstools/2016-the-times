While thousands of fans across the country are mourning the gospel icon who touched the lives of many through his contribution to music - his family are mourning the loss of a son, husband, father and brother.Sipho explained that Sfiso's mother, Fikile Ncwane, met the devastating news with so much shock. "Like any other elderly person who just found out about the death of their son, she was in a lot of shock, which caused her to feel ill. Her sugar levels went up."However, Sipho revealed that she has since recovered in the past few hours and is "feeling a bit better".It is also understood that Sfiso's wife, Ayanda , is doing much better after "a very tough day" yesterday."Yesterday was a very tough day for her. But today she's showing signs of improvement. At least she's now able to speak. We have been having meetings with her to discuss funeral and memorial service arrangements, and she has been able to have her say in all the planning," Sipho explained.According to the family spokesperson, Sfiso's family members from KZN have arrived in Johannesburg, and are already in full swing with making funeral and memorial service arrangements.The gospel singer will be laid to rest at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban this Saturday 10 December at 11am.There will be two memorial services held in honour of Sfiso: one in Durban at the Ethekwini Community Church (ECC) on Thursday, 8 December at 11am, and one in Johannesburg on Friday, 9 December, at an unconfirmed venue.Sfiso died on Monday morning after being rushed to a Johannesburg hospital.
