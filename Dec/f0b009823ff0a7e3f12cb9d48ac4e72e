Speaking at the funeral of ANC stalwart and Mkhonto weSizwe veteran Riot Mkhwanazi on Sunday Zuma said his wish was based on the ANC's performance in his home municipality which was won by the IFP in the August 3 local government election."When I say I want to contest to be a councillor in my ward when I take my pension people laugh. But it's not personal it's organisational. I was telling the mayor of Vereeniging yesterday my ambition is to be mayor of Nkandla one day " he said.Zuma praised Mkhwanazi for accepting a position as a councillor in Zululand despite his struggle credentials saying that he didn't want to be "up there somewhere" among the top positions."We must aspire to be like him " he said.Mkhwanazi died age 83 last Sunday. He leaves behind three children and seven grandchildren. He was granted an official state funeral which was addressed by family and political leaders including KZN Premier Willies Mchunu and provincial ANC chairman Sihle Zikalala.TMG Digital
