African National Congress MPL Christian Martin and Astra Primary School principal Desmond Lewis became embroiled in a heated squabble with the politician claiming the no-fee school was withholding reports until parents had made the donations.But Lewis insisted it was a misunderstanding and that Martin s presence at the school was merely grandstanding.Following the brouhaha chaos ensued in the foyer of the school with Lewis asking Martin to leave the premises before he addressed more than 40 parents and guardians in the staff room.The meeting in the staff room was then disrupted by Martin and parents supporting him and Lewis asked parents to make their way to a classroom and restricted Martin s access.Martin opened a criminal case at the Bethelsdorp police station later against Lewis and school governing board chairman Marcel Esbach for contravening and violating the Schools Act.Lewis said later: All the parents had previously agreed to pay the voluntary contribution and should they not be able to afford that contribution they could offer their services by cutting grass or taking care of a class in the event a teacher is absent. We understand that parents in our community are not always able to pay the sum but we are also struggling to keep our doors open and the children educated. This contribution from the parents helps cover expenses like teachers salaries. Lewis said the parents and teachers had come to an agreement that parents who were unable to pay the voluntary contribution when schools closed on December 7 could do so on Monday and collect the reports.Martin was contacted by a disgruntled parent who claimed the report of his son in Grade 5 was being withheld because he had not paid the outstanding donation.Full report in The Herald TMG Digital/The Herald
