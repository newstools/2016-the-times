The row began when East London resident Sheridene Wattrus's boerboel, Zeus, attacked her mother's boyfriend on her property two years ago, ripping off one of his ears.A long and costly lawsuit ended with a court finding this month that she was liable for what her dog did.Her mother testified against her.Brian Trollip told the East London High Court that Zeus pounced when he and Wattrus's mother went to the Wattrus's home in Nahoon for dinner on the night of April 15 2014.Zeus had killed a poodle outside the property the day before.Trollip said he had offered to train the dog, which he described as a "young pup" weighing about 60kg."[Trollip] had told [Wattrus], as a pretext for getting involved on this basis, that he had been involved in the formal training of dogs while serving in the army many years ago," the judgment reads."This included obedience training with mostly Rottweilers, German shepherds, sheepdogs as guard dogs."He fitted the dog with its choke chain and walked it up and down the driveway several times. He was impressed with the progress. Trouble started as he was taking the chain off and a neighbour's dog barked."[Zeus] knocked him over and bit him on his arm, hand, throat, and ultimately his face and ear, ripping the ear off in the process and pulling the skin off his skull. [Trollip] screamed but managed ultimately to call the dog to order."Wattrus denied she was liable for the attack.She said Trollip knew that she kept a fierce dog on her property, that the dog did not like being fitted with a collar and leash, and that such a dog was "liable to bite and injure a person with whom it was not familiar".Wattruss said that, despite knowing this, Trollip went into the place where Zeus was isolated at the back of the property and "freely and voluntarily assumed the risk of injury to himself".But Judge Belinda Hartle found Wattrus liable for the attack and ordered her to compensate Trollip and pay his legal costs.The amount of the damages claim will be determined later.
