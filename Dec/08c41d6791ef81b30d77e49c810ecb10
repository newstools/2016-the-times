I choose to not be silent when I see in the news or hear about corrective rape occurring in South Africa. When I hear about a young girl who is murdered because she is lesbian."Homophobes, get it into your skull. Being gay is just like being black or being white, you don't choose. you are just that. And the justice system, you are failing us. You are the reason why they think they can get away with murder," he said in the video.He went on to further lambaste people with homophobic attitudes, telling them that their hate would not change his sexuality."All you homophobes.
