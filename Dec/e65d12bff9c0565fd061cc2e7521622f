HIV/AIDS has been a major health concern in SA for over three decades. Over the years there have been several government attempts to combat it. The evolution of condoms in SA is one example. Remember the silver wrapper? With the many red ribbons? That pilot project saw us through many stigmas and fears in the 90s. It was later replaced by the blue branded Choice wrapper in 2004 to make condom use more attractive and promote safer sex. And in 2016 Our government is still making sure that we have safer sex in style.
