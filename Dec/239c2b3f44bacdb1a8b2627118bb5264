According to the Herald, the fires in the western parts of the Bay are being fanned by strong winds of up to 48 knots, which are expected to only start abating at about 10pm.Several properties including homes and business in areas such as Lorraine and Kamma Heights are also being evacuated. Vincent Erasmus who has lived in Theescombe for 30 years says it is the worst fire he has ever seen. Veld fires have been burning across the Bay, where water restrictions have been implemented, since the weekend. Port Elizabeth weather office spokesman Garth Sampson said the wind would slowly die down to 16 knots by midnight, which could still cause problems . He said there was no rain forecast and advised the public to take precautions. Meanwhile members of the public have collected food and refreshments for firefighters and other emergency workers. An extreme terrain adventure company has obtained permission to access the area and will take the food to the firefighters. Those who want to do so may drop off items at the Kabega Park police station. - Herald LIVE
