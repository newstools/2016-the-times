The decision was occasioned by the fact that this year workers in the country will only have 11 public holidays instead of 12 due to the fact that the 25th of December (Christmas Day) falls on a Sunday. According to section 2(1) of the Public Holidays Act 1994 whenever a public holiday falls on a Sunday the following Monday shall be a public holiday . However this year the Monday following the 25th of December 2016 is another public holiday being 26 December 2016 Day of Goodwill. This has resulted in the two public holidays overlapping the Presidency said.It said the declaration of the 27th December as a public holiday would ensure that workers were not unduly disadvantaged because of this unusual event and were still entitled to their 12 paid public holidays.
