The national broadcaster's official TV schedule for January was released recently, and listed Generations as airing on SABC 3 at 7:30pm from 16 January.Speaking to TshisaLIVE on Thursday, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago explained that the broadcaster had decided to move the soapie to the slot because of their African Cup of Nations coverage on SABC 1."The African Cup of Nations will be broadcast live on SABC 1. But we understand that not everyone likes soccer so we have had to move our popular shows onto other platforms. This is nothing new. We have done this with Generations many times and Generations is not the only show that will be affected by the move," Kaizer explained.Kaizer said that Generations was still an important part of the broadcaster's portfolio and denied that the move to SABC 3 had relegated the status of the show in any way."The show remains one of our key properties and by moving it to another station we are allowing viewers to still be able to watch it on a daily basis," Kaizer said.The new slot means that Generations will replace SABC 3 drama series High Rollers for the duration of the soccer tournament. High Rollers recently made headlines after it was announced that the show would be cancelled by the broadcaster.Kaizer shut down any suggestions that the decision to move Generations to SABC 3 had anything to do with this cancellation."It is rubbish, absolute rubbish, to suggest that the two decisions are related. Such suggestions are made simply to cause unnecessary panic," Kaizer said angrily. Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
