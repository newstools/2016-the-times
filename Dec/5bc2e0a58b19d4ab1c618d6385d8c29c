Dozens of children were swimming at the Zoo Lake pool when fumes from acid used to unblock a nearby drain blew into the pool area.Twenty children were checked by paramedics and 12 were taken to hospital for observation. They were later discharged.Kutlwano Olifant, spokesman for Johannesburg member of the mayoral committee for community development Nonhlanhla Sifumba, said officials were trying to establish who poured acid into the drainage system.Earlier reports suggested that the acid had been added to the pool but Olifant said the incident took place outside the pool's vicinity.She said when people were asked to leave, some parents smashed windows of the cashier's office and an official was injured. Olifant said a case of assault had been opened.ER24 spokesman Chitra Bodasing said the children were treated for minor injuries. Those who showed signs of breathing difficulties were also treated.The pool was reopened to swimmers yesterday.
