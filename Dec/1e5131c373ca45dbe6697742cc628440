The show was dropped and then reinstated in 2013 after a listener uproar.On Tuesday the company paid tribute to the host saying: "Eleanor has built the show into appointment listening for fans of all ages who tune in for her nostalgic mix of standards and big band sounds that evoke memories of yesteryear. She took over a version of the show from John Berks when he left 702 and injected her own personality into the Bandstand as well as her personal music collection much of which she grew up listening to with her father."Radio 702 station manager Thabisile Mbete said: "Eleanor has given fans so much of herself for so many years. While we know that she will be missed we wish her a wonderful new experience: Saturday nights to spend with her own friends and family."Moore was quoted as thanking her fans: "I would sincerely like to thank all the devoted and loyal listeners for their overwhelming support of the programme over so many years. I was truly privileged to have been given a platform to share my own collection of music with you."For the last 11 and a half years she has hosted the show on 702 and CapeTalk each Saturday night and has only missed one show in all that time.She says she is most looking forward to being able to travel in the new year.Primedia said the 702 and CapeTalk Saturday evening line ups for 2017 "are still being finalised and listeners will be informed of the new shows in due course".
