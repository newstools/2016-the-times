The participation of veteran fullback Tsepo Masilela is also unsure and whether he and Khune travel to Port Elizabeth on Friday may only be determined after a morning training session on Friday.Khune went off on Tuesday night with a muscle pull after making a point-blank save in the second half of the 1-1 draw with Cape Town City at FNB Stadium.He has been undergoing treatment at Naturena even though the Chiefs squad had the day off on Thursday after a recuperation session on Wednesday officials said on Thursday.It is looking positive that Khune will recover and make the trip but Masilela must still be assessed.If Masilela is not fit Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela faces a dilemma at left-back after Sibusiso Khumalo was sent off on Tuesday. Khumalo is suspended for the next two matches and if Masilela can t make it then Komphela will have to utilise a makeshift fullback likely to be Daniel Cardoso or out-of-favour Kgotso Moleko who is usually employed on the right but might be press-ganged into service on the left.If Cardoso is moved across and with Mathoho s groin injury not healed Komphela has to choose a central defensive partner for Lorenzo Gordinho.The coach can either give Siyanda Xulu who he has largely ignored over the last 18 months a rare run out or use Moleko at right-back and push Ramahlwe Mphalale to centreback.Chiefs travel to Port Elizabeth with mounting pressure after their winless streak was stretched to six games on Tuesday night. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
