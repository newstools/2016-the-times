Mzokhona Dlame 46 a former ANC ward councillor candidate in Nongoma northern KwaZulu-Natal was gunned down at his home in KwaLuphonjwana village at about 8pm on Monday.The brazen attack came the same day as his family celebrated Umemulo a traditional coming of age ceremony held for his daughter. Dlame is the fourth high-profile ANC member to be murdered in the last month. Two IFP members were also killed in the last week as political violence has flared up again.On Tuesday the SACP claimed that a hit squad was operating in Inchanga west of Durban following the shooting last week of the Shozi brothers Ndumiso 27 and Thbani 25. We are devastated and shocked by the continuation of senseless killings of our most dedicated and hard-working comrades said ANC Provincial Secretary Super Zuma. This is a tragic loss for his family for the ANC and the people of KwaNongoma. We call on the police to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that comrade Dlame s killers account for their callous act. - TMG Digital/The Times
