Seema and co-coach John Maduka were asked by club management to take over on an interim basis after Serame Letsoaka was sacked in October.In all the media engagements they've had since their appointment Seema and Maduka have inevitably been asked if they have designs on the top job.Speaking ahead of his side s crucial league clash against Pirates at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday night the 36 year-old Seema got the question out of the way and said he's more concerned with getting the maximum points that will be up for grabs than his future career prospects at Celtic."I will push up until the management make an announcement (about the vacant head coaching position) " he said."At the moment I am the interim coach with John Maduka and we remain in charge up until there's an announcement."Whether we win the game (against Pirates) or we lose it our future really lies with the management."The two coaches have been in charge for six games and they have won one lost two and drawn three."We are not even thinking about whether we will take the job permanently or what we are just trying to steer the ship in the right direction."We need points than thinking about whether they will take us as permanent coaches."Celtic are struggling to find consistency in their league campaign and are close to the relegation zone in 13th position with 12 points from 13 games.Wounded Pirates are still fresh from a 2-1 defeat against Maritzburg United a week ago will be desperate to win their final match of the year especially at home. - TMG Digital
