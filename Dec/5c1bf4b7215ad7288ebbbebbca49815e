The Chili Boyz host Chiefs at Nelson Mandela Stadium in Saturday s Premier Soccer League match-up (kickoff 6pm).Chippa came from a goal down to rescue a point through winger Thembinkosi Lorch s 75th minute equaliser against Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium on Tuesday night.Malesela will hope that a big game against Chiefs in front of a packed stadium can spark some life back into his exciting attacking team who have lost their way after a bright start to slump to 11th place after 10 games. We have forced changes due to injuries so we have to get the balance right on Saturday Chippa s coach said. We take lessons from each and every game we play and it was not different against Maritzburg United on Tuesday where we came back with a valuable point. Malesela said Chippa need to rediscover their sharpness in front of goal. We had the same story on Tuesday and I am hoping in fact I believe that this story where we concede one and then miss 10 chances will end on Saturday he said. The expression on the player s faces after the Maritzburg game was that we need to start scoring goals. Come Saturday I think we will added Malesela with confidence.Chiefs have had struggles of their own having not won in six league and cup games. They are in fifth place in the PSL.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
