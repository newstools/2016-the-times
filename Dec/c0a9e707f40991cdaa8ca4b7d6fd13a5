According to the Independent, a study conducted at McGill University in Canada found that there is a link between sex and the growth of nervous tissue in the hippocampus - the area of the brain that controls emotions, memory and the nervous system.The connection could be due to the fact that sex is a form of exercise, or that it helps to ease depression and stress which directly impacts ones memory. This research however did not pinpoint how often these women had sex or whether achieving orgasm affects the memory.The research team sampled 78 heterosexual women under the age of 30, who were asked to take part in memory games such as remembering faces and remembering abstract words. They were also asked about their sexual activity and if there were on birth control.
