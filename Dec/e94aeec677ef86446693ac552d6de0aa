Other seizures by the 15 companies of troops deployed on the border included: Among the thousands of people stopped by soldiers during regular patrols 15 467 were found to be (undocumented) said SANDF spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Piet Paxton. They were all handed over to South African Police Service Police and Department of Home Affairs officials for further processing. Paxton said South Africa s 4 471km land border and 2 798km of coastline poses a huge challenge on current force levels . The troops conducted round-the-clock patrols using horses motorcycles dogs and helicopters. Most clothing and footwear was confiscated from people entering from Mozambique while the Zimbabwe border was the main entry point for illegal cigarettes. Both countries were also the source of almost all the undocumented people trying to enter South Africa. The Free State/Lesotho and Eastern Cape/Lesotho borders were where the majority of livestock rustlers were apprehended and these borders are also the chosen entry point of dagga smugglers said Paxton.
