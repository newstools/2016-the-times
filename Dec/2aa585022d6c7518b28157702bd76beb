But Muthambi was defiant, telling parliament that she had not interfered in SABC editorial policy, despite testimony by other witnesses to the contrary."I don't work at the SABC ... I don't have any influence in the SABC's editorial decisions," she said.Muthambi, a supporter of the corporation's former COO, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, said she had "no personal knowledge" of a R10-million bonus he had been awarded and was not involved in the decision to increase his salary."On matter of the bonus, I read it in papers. After reading I wrote to the company secretary. She promised to give me the minutes of [the board meeting at which it was approved]," said Muthambi.She claimed she was not aware of the reportedly dictatorial behaviour of Motsoeneng, despite being told of it in writing by former board member Hope Zinde.Motsoeneng has been a central figure in the inquiries of the parliamentary committee set up to investigate allegations against the SABC, and the fitness of its board members to hold office.He has been accused of running the SABC as a personal fiefdom.The committee had previously heard that board members complained about Motsoeneng's conduct to Muthambi, who - representing the corporation's sole shareholder, the government - is meant to oversee the broadcaster and its board."I don't recall anyone complaining about the conduct of Mr Motsoeneng," said Muthambi."Hope [Zinde], what she raised [was that] she was not seeing eye to eye with former board chairperson (Ellen Tshabalala). I didn't receive any complaint [about] Mr Motsoeneng, formally so," said Muthambi.EFF MP Fana Mokoena questioned Muthambi about her decision to give Motsoeneng a permanent appointment as COO of the SABC despite the revelation that he had lied to the corporation when he said he had ended his schooling with a matric pass."At the time, that was the correct decision," she said.Muthambi said she was not aware of the board's refusal to hand over key documents to the inquiry committee.Committee chairman Vincent Smith (ANC) said the SABC and its lawyers had clearly been contemptuous of parliament in refusing to had over the documents.Asked whether she would take responsibility for the sorry state of the broadcaster, Muthambi said she would take responsibility for failures in oversight - but so should parliament, she maintained.Responding to the ANC's Makhosi Khoza on whether she was distancing herself, the representative of the shareholder, from the affairs of the SABC, Muthambi said "no".She said she was not exonerating herself but "governance failure of the SABC shouldn't be attributed to the shareholder"."It should be a collective responsibility."Ruling party and opposition MPs appeared unimpressed with many of Muthambi's responses.The DA's Phumzile van Damme questioned what she described as Muthambi's over-reliance on the team accompanying her to the committee hearing.ANC MP Patrick Chauke said the organisation has had three boards in 10 years, and 12 CEOs since 2008."The accounting authority of the organisation has collapsed," he said.Committee member Juli Killian said nothing had changed at the SABC since Muthambi was a member of the communications portfolio committee."If I look at the number of special meetings, there is no governance. I'm not even talking about time when the board is not quorate. The interpretation [of the Broadcasting Act] from your legal team differs significantly from what we've presented at parliament."Muthambi said former board members Krish Naidoo and Vusumzi Mavuso confessed to her at an SABC meeting on April 15 that they had not read the Broadcasting Act."Now I've seen their statements, they've now become experts on the law."Asked about the controversial MultiChoice deal in which the pay-TV operator gained access to the SABC's archive, Muthambi fiercely denied claims that the SABC had sold a national asset.She said the sale was decided on by the previous board and she was "surprised" that the matter was part of the current inquiry.She said Ronnie Lubisi, Mavuso and previous board members had signed the deal."Some issues predate my assumption of office as minister," said Muthambi.Muthambi defended the amendment of the SABC memorandum of understanding that gave her powers to fire and hire, saying the amendments had come into being before her time as minister.She said she hoped parliament would carry out its inquiry quickly to allow an interim board to be appointed.
