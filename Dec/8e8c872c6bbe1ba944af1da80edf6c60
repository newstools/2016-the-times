Dikgacoi returned to Golden Arrows in October after seven years playing in England and has slotted into the midfield despite being clearly short of the required match fitness.But Larsen says the former Bafana Bafana midfielder is still an effective weapon and has given him a free role in the centre of the park to bring his experience to the team. We have been using him as a free player in midfield we do have [Danny] Phiri [Musa] Bilankulu and [Nkanyiso] Cele playing in those areas as well Larsen says. But what we try to do at times is when he drops deep we get one of the other guys forward. But he is still finding his feet and his fitness."With our first game of the second round [in the PSL] only being in February we are going to have ample time in January to really work on his fitness. He has such a lot to offer he has great vision a calmness in possession which is what we sometimes lack with the young players and I am sure he is going to be a great asset in the second round."Golden Arrows are just three points off second place in the league and have lost just four of their 12 games to date.Larsen says they are ahead of where they want to be though has set a goal of 24 points by Christmas which means they need another six from games against BidVest Wits (home) Baroka FC (away) and Kaizer Chiefs (home). We have punched above our weight so far this season and we have always complemented our players on the effort they give us."The work ethic has been tremendous throughout the team throughout the season Larsen says. And if we continue to work fight this way especially on the road we will be there or thereabouts come the end of the season. We have set ourselves a target of eight points for every five games we play."And we have achieved that in the first 10 games."We are looking to get to at least 24 points in the first half of the season. If we can do the same in the second half then 48 points would give you a comfortable top six position and as a club that is where we want to be. Golden Arrows will host Wits in their next match on Wednesday next week.- TMG Digital
