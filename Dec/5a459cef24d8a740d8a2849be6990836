Cuthbert Malajila gave Wits the lead in the 70th minute after he finished off a beautifully crafted buildup initiated by teenage prodigy Phakamani Mahlambi.But the stubborn hosts came storming right back when Mohau Mokate equalised four minutes later following a goal-mouth scramble.Maritzburg were reduced to ten men just before the halftime break after Kurt Lentjies was sent off for a bad challenge on Phumlani Ntshangase.But the home side never floundered under the pressure, despite the one- man disadvantage, and not only were they able to claw their way back and equalise, they also held their nerve to escape with a point against a team many tip for the PSL title.Wits coach Gavin Hunt was understandably not a happy man after the game and thought that the visitors had done enough to return from Pietermaritzburg with all the three points. - TMG Digital
