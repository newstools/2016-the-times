The court said the initial disciplinary hearing that cleared Motsoeneng of wrongdoing was "wholly inadequate".Details of his reign were also laid bare in parliament yesterday, with allegations surfacing that the politically connected Gupta family attempted to take complete control of SABC news prior to the launch of their news channel, ANN7. More revelations are expected on Tuesday as the Parliamentary ad hoc committee inquiry into the SABC gets underway again.
