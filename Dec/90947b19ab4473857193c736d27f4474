Willem Lubbe station commander of the National Sea Rescue Institute at Yzerfontein said that the NSRI duty crew in the town had been activated late on Saturday afternoon following reports that a child was missing in the surf zone at Pearl Bay. The sea rescue craft Spirit of Iffley and our rescue vehicle responded to the scene and the SA Police Services Dynamic ambulance services and the EMS/AMS Skymed rescue helicopter were dispatched. On arrival on the scene an extensive sea air and shore search revealed no sign of the child and a Police Dive Unit joined the search and they will continue with an ongoing search operation said Lubbe.He added that police had opened an investigation. It appears that the family from Malmesbury were on the beach for the day. During the rising tide the child is believed to have been playing in the water when rip currents swept the child out to sea Lubbe said.
