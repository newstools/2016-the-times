Who am I to question God after I have seen him through you my love, Ayanda wrote in her letter.Ayanda added that she could not describe the amount of love and honour Sfiso gave her in words. You declared me the most beautiful woman you ever laid your eyes on. You treated me like a queen, she wrote.In the heart-wrenching letter Ayanda said she believed that Sfiso s sudden death was part of a secret plan between him and God. I didn t know what you meant when you said, love I need you to be strong because I m about to go away on a world tour now that I am not afraid of flying. I am sure that your death was a secret plan between you and God. A perfectly designed plan. God will refer to you as his humble son. Ayanda added thanked Sfiso for the love he showered her since she was 18 years old. I am one of the few privileged wives who can claim and brag about the forever together. You gave me the perfect experience of love. Goodnight my babe and see you in the morning.
