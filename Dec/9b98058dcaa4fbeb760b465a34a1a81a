The papers ask the court for a declaratory order that President Zuma has violated his constitutional obligations in not giving effect to the remedial action set out in Public Protector s State Capture report by establishing a Commission of Inquiry by 2 December 2016.Maimane explained the Public Protector s remedial action in the State of Capture report required the President to appoint a Commission of Inquiry headed by a judge selected by the Chief Justice within 30 days of the release of the report in order to further investigate matters of State Capture particularly areas which the Public Protector was unable to due to time and financial constraints."The President has failed to do so and is thus once again in breach of the Constitution " he said."Our application seeks the Constitutional Court to compel President Zuma to give effect to this remedial action and appoint the commission within 10 days of the order of the court."The legal action follows a letter written to the President s Office by the DA s legal team on November 25 stating it was their view that his intention to institute review proceedings against the report would not absolve him from having to comply with the remedial action within the report's specified timeframes."The President would have to obtain a court order to stay or suspend the obligation to comply with the Public Protector s recommendations which he has not done " Maimane said."The President s response to this letter was dismissive leaving us with no choice but to seek a court order."
