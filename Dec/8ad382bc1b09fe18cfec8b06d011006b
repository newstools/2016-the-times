Western Cape community safety MEC Dan Plato tried to distance himself yesterday from the tussle between Sylvano Hendricks - also known as Queenie Madikizela-Malema - and Jacques de Bruyn, owner of the Wolwedans guesthouse in Groot Brak Rivier.Plato denied Hendricks's claim that he was on official business for the MEC when he ran up a bill of R87,000 for accommodation and meals during a two-month stay. The bill has not been paid.Hendricks also allegedly made off with a car belonging to De Bruyn's wife.The politician admits that Hendricks was an informant - "[He] forwards information to me; I forward information to the police" - and said he had asked Hendricks to return the car."Mrs De Bruyn phoned me on Sunday afternoon," said Plato."She said to me, 'Mr Plato, please ask Mr Hendricks just to give my car back.' So I said to her, 'I do have his cell number and I will give him a call and I will ask him to do everything possible to return the car'."Speaking to The Times yesterday, Hendricks denied having the car since September 30, or receiving a call on Sunday from Plato.The row spilled into the public domain on Wednesday when De Bruyn wrote a Facebook post about the unpaid bill and the missing car, a Chevrolet Cruze."He claims that I borrowed my wife's car to him indefinitely in exchange for sexual favours," said De Bruyn.De Bruyn and Plato gave different versions of a meeting they had in Mossel Bay, each alleging that he was threatened by the other.The guesthouse owner told The Times he had "written off" the money he was owed by Hendricks, but said his wife wanted her car back and was still paying it off. But when she asked for its return the drag queen replied on WhatsApp: "Haha f*** you, enjoy paying."
