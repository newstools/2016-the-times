In a statement commemorating the 20th anniversary of the implementation of the country s democratic constitution Maimane said it was a shame that Zuma who derived his authority from the Constitution had been found to have undermined and violated that which he swore before the people of South Africa to protect uphold and defend. The drafters of the highest law in the land never foresaw that such a compromised and corrupt individual would be entrusted with bringing the Constitution to life. Maimane added that as South Africa marked 20 years of democratic constitutionalism it needed to reflect on the type of society and leadership that was envisioned by the authors of one of the most progressive and liberal constitutions in the world.The drafters of the highest law in the land he said had envisioned honest and accountable leadership from not only the President but also the Speaker of Parliament and the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court as well as other bodies such as the Public Protector who derived their mandate and authority directly from the Constitution. Our Constitution both cognisant of the past and well aware of the country that needs to be built eloquently and profoundly states in the preamble that We the people of South Africa Recognise the injustices of our past; Honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land; Respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it united in our diversity. We therefore through our freely elected representatives adopt this Constitution as the supreme law of the Republic These words as powerful as they are are only as good as those entrusted with and empowered by them. Maimane said the preamble to the Constitution committed the nation s leadership to Improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of each person .However the ANC and Jacob Zuma had abandoned the idea of serving the people and now only served themselves and a narrow political agenda that was marked by corruption lawlessness and self-enrichment. We must continue to advance the provisions of the Constitution especially the Bill of Rights which talks about equality human dignity freedom of association housing and other fundamental rights. May we forever guard the sanctity of the Constitution and believe that we will change our country in order to ensure that we build a country for all its people based on the values of Freedom Fairness and Opportunity Maimane said.
