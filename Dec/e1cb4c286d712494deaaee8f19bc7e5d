Off-duty police constable Momelezi Mpanza 29 who was stationed at the Port Elizabeth Airport and his girlfriend Ntobosindisa Ngube 33 were found dead inside a Kwazakhele home on Tuesday evening in what police believe to have been a murder-suicide.Ngube worked for a private security company.The incident happened shortly after 5pm while Mpanza was visiting Ngube at her Nomjila Street home.The couple had been dating for about four months.Mpanza s body was found in the bedroom with his state-issue firearm next to him and Ngube s body was found in the kitchen.One of Mpanza s best friends Mpho Dyantyi said that about a half an hour before the incident Mpanza had called asking him to bring petrol to Ngube s house because his car was out of fuel. When I arrived there were people at the house already Dyantyi said. I went inside and saw her [Ngube] and then found him. I am still shocked and can t believe it. He was such a responsible person and would always try to defuse and calm a situation instead of using force. I really do not know what could have happened that led to this. Dyantyi said that when Mpanza phoned him he had been absolutely calm. There was nothing out of the ordinary. He just asked me to bring some petrol he said.-More In The Herald.
