These are all questions that people tried to answer in 2016.5: Scientists put penguin on a treadmillKing penguin males are known for going hungry for as long as a month at a time to protect their eggs, but they compensate for this by fattening themselves up first.Scientists wanted to know how this impacted their waddle, so researchers captured 10 big fat males, then made them walk on a treadmills. They then took half of the birds and made them fast for two weeks after which they filmed them on the treadmill again.What they found was when the penguins were big and fat, they fell over more and had a more exaggerated waddle.

When they get tired, the engine can work on battery power, while the driver controls the brakes and steering. It has also been modified with solar panels to further add power.The electric trike meanwhile is powered with a single electric hub motor, and some human pedal power for climbing steep hills. 2: Whales beat the Christmas rush to Cape Town Just before Christmas a giant pod of humpback whales descended on the ocean near Cape Town to feed.Drone pilot Kieran Donnelly caught the action with footage that showed "at least 60" humpback whales migrating south.1: Elephants have a nose for explosivesChishuru, a 17-year-old male elephant has a nose for explosives, as demonstrated by this video.In 2007 researchers discovered than an elephant herd in Angola was avoiding landmine fields left over from the civil war. The researchers wanted to know how the elephants knew about the bombs.It turns out that their extremely good sense of smell allows them to sniff the mines out, though researchers aren t keen to actually send them out as minesweepers.Instead they plan to take samples from suspected minefields and have the elephants sniff them, in order to work on landmine area reduction.
