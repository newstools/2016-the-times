Gross domestic product expanded by only 0.2% in the period between July and September compared with a revised 3.5% in the second quarter, Statistics SA said yesterday.The rand firmed in response to the release of the data, touching a session high of 13.6400/ dollar from 13.7300/dollar before its release.On a year-on-year basis the economy grew at 0.7% from 0.6% previously.The meagre growth in the quarter was led by a 3.2% decline in the manufacturing sector, followed by a 2.8% decline in the electricity sector and a 2.1% contraction in trade and accommodation."The decline in manufacturing is very concerning," chief economist at Nedbank Nicky Weimar commented.Manufacturing now accounts for only 13% of the economy, down from about 25% two decades ago.
