Independent Police Investigative Directorate boss Robert McBride, private investigator Paul O'Sullivan, former Gauteng Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya and suspended crime intelligence agent Captain Candice Coetzee are alleged to have plotted to ignite a "South African Arab Spring".The revolt they are said to have plotted, according to Gauteng Hawks boss Major-General Prince Mokotedi, was to start in the first week of next month.But Mokotedi's allegations have been rejected with scorn by academics and other commentators. "It's about the protection of self-interest and diverting attention from corruption and governance scandals," said one."To say this is the start of an Arab Spring is laughable," said another.In an affidavit submitted to the Hawks for further investigation, Mokotedi claims his law enforcement colleagues planned to murder his bosses - Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza and national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane.State Security Agency director-general Arthur Fraser and National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams were also targets of the alleged plot. McBride, O'Sullivan, Sibiya and Coetzee are now the subjects of an investigation into treason, espionage and conspiracy to commit murder.Mokotedi told The Times that the planned killings, to be masked as hijackings, were to be carried out with the help of Serbian hitmen and Zimbabwean intelligence agents."Crime intelligence brought the information to us," Mokotedi told The Times. "We immediately began monitoring the conspirators. We learned that their plans were finalised and were due for execution when O'Sullivan returns from the UK in January."The hitmen and the alleged plotters have links to high-profile investigations including one leading to the downfall of Czech crime boss Radovan Krejcir, and the rendition of Zimbabwean nationals to their home country.O'Sullivan was instrumental in bringing down Krejcir.McBride exonerated former Hawks head Anwa Dramat and Sibiya from culpability in the renditions before himself being charged and suspended for allegedly altering a report into the Ipid investigation of the renditions.McBride's suspension was lifted by the Constitutional Court.The allegations and counterallegations that emerged yesterday are evidence of an intensification of the internecine war among crime fighters.Policing and politics analysts question the veracity of the allegations, the consensus being that they are nothing but a smoke screen.McBride wasted no time hitting back."We expected to be targeted - if we can't take the heat then we must get out of the kitchen. Unfortunately for some people, we know how to take heat," he said."This will collapse like the rendition matter collapsed ... we are unafraid, we are not intimidated."McBride said it was not surprising that the charges against him and his fellow "conspirators" were brought only hours after a statement given under warning was obtained from Ntlemeza and the docket detailing the allegations against Phahlane was submitted to the director of public prosecutions.Koffi Kouakou, of the Wits School of Governance, said South Africa was in "a deadly political mess"."It's about the protection of self-interest and diverting attention away from corruption and governance scandals."[President Jacob] Zuma fired the first warning shot when he told people in KwaZulu-Natal that he has information on everyone. That warning was fired again this month by the police commissioner, when he warned O'Sullivan - who has helped Ipid investigate him for corruption - that he was 'coming for him'," Kouakou said.He said the nation's leadership had collapsed."From the head down, there is no fear of repercussions for wrongdoing. The country is infected with syndromes of corruption."Kouakou said the accusations against the "conspirators" were designed to silence criticism."It happened under President Thabo Mbeki when security agents were pitted against each other. This time it's taken on a far more sinister tone."He said the security and stability of the state were in jeopardy."Functional systems have deliberately been replaced with dysfunctional ones. What we see is corruption of the entire political system."Unisa criminologist Anthony Minnaar said: "When you talk of espionage and treason you talk of regime change. It's what terrorists are charged for."To say this is the start of an Arab Spring is laughable."Those being targeted are those who fear for the safety of our constitutional democracy."
