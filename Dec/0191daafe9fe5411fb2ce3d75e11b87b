Former SABC group executive of human resources Jabulani Mabaso told Parliament s ad hoc committee looking into the crisis at the corporation that Motsoeneng was the de facto CEO and some of the major meetings were held in his office. At the SABC the CEO s office is on the 28th floor the [chief operating officer] is on the 27th floor but the meetings are held on the 27th floor said Mabaso.He said Motsoeneng often undermined the CEOs most prominently former CEO Lulama Mokhobo.Mabaso added that Motsoeneng was not vetted prior to his appointment to the post of group executive of corporate affairs.He lost his job as SABC chief operating officer in September after the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed his application for leave to appeal against a ruling by the Western Cape High Court setting aside his permanent appointment. The SABC then announced that it had reappointed him to his previous post of group executive for corporate affairs.The current acting chief operating officer Gugu Tugwana had also not been vetted said Mabaso.Sipho Masinga a former executive for IT at the SABC told the inquiry that Mokhobo used to cry in her office because of her difficult working relationship with Motsoeneng. He would attack people who report to the CEO he always wanted to have the final say and spoke last [in meetings] said Masinga.Motsoeneng would tell staffers that if they cannot work with him they should leave said Masinga.The inquiry is scheduled to hear from the so-called SABC eight later on Monday.Earlier on Monday Motsoeneng was dealt a heavy blow after the High Court in Cape Town declared his appointment irrational and unlawful .The court ruled on Monday that Motsoeneng was not entitled to occupy any position at SABC until a damning 2014 report by the Public Protector is set aside or new disciplinary processes against him are finalised. The court said the initial disciplinary hearing that cleared Motsoeneng of any wrongdoing was wholly inadequate .Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane said on Monday Motsoeneng must pack his bags . As at this point in time the Public Protector s report stands therefore Mr Motsoeneng should immediately vacate his office at the SABC s Auckland Park headquarters and a disciplinary process must be instituted and conducted in a transparent and accountable manner said Maimane.Motsoeneng s lawyer Zola Majavu told Business Live on Monday that the High Court ruling did not mean his client has to immediately vacate his office. He said he had not yet received instructions to appeal the ruling. It does not mean that [he has to vacate office immediately] until he is served with a charge sheet and if he decides not to appeal but for now I don t have instructions but pending the disciplinary hearing the court said he must be suspended said Majavu.- TMG Digital/Business Live
