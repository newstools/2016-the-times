Not even the most ardent Zuma backers could hide their frustration at the president s late arrival the Economic Freedom Lecture which was billed to start at midday.Zuma only arrived at about 3pm. Hundreds of ANCYL supporters sang Ake kusheshe ngoba thina silambile [please hurry up because we are hungry] . And not even an attempt to placate them by Durban kwaito artist T'zozo could douse their ire. Zuma and ANCYL president Collins Maine were the headline speakers at the event which was also attended by SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni and the Decolonisation Foundation s Mzwanele Manyi. The late start was also likely to have an impact on the elderly residents of Savannah Park west of Durban who Zuma was meant to spend time with on Wednesday afternoon.The president was apparently delayed in Nkandla by an urgent family commitment. - TMG Digital/The Times
