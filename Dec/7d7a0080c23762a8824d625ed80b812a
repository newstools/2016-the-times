The crowd was monitored by a strong contingent of police at the High Court in Durban.Khanyile who was arrested on September 27 after clashes with police during the Fees Must Fall protests is facing eight charges that include public violence illegal gathering and inciting violence.Khanyile has been in jail for 77 days and has twice been denied bail - once in October and again in November.He is hoping to convince the High Court that a magistrate erred when he was denied bail.Magistrate Jackie Jonck denied him bail in October after the court heard that he had a strong influence over students and that lecturers would be reluctant to give statements to police because they were fearful.Video evidence allegedly shows Khanyile assaulting police and encouraging students to moer the police and of using a slingshot.During his first court appearance prosecutor Roshiela Benimadho opposed bail arguing that he is facing serious charges and that he had pending similar matters committed at DUT previously and in Umlazi.He was among those who led a march to the KwaZulu-Natal legislature and threatened Speaker Lydia Johnson that if she did not act on their grievances they would forcibly storm the legislature to enact no fee laws.At his bail application in November defence advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi told the court that violent demonstrations no longer persisted as the Fees Must Fall campaign had changed tactics from protest to diplomacy.His legal fees are being paid by the EFF.On Wednesday morning Ngcukaitobi told judge Nkosinathi Chili that Khanyile's supporters were not being allowed into court. State advocate Kavil Singh said he had asked the court manager and registrar on Tuesday via email for additional security in anticipation of many people attending. A security manager said a maximum of 30 people will be allowed.The matter is proceeding.- TMG Digital and The Times/Durban
