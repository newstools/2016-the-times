Party leader Jeremy Acton told the Cape Town High Court yesterday that prisoners with cannabis-related convictions should be released.Acton and other pro-cannabis activists, including Rastafarian and lawyer Garreth Prince, have applied to the court to have the prohibition of cannabis declared unconstitutional."We ask that all cannabis prisoners be released and that previous convictions be wiped clean," said Acton, who appeared before a full bench of the court.Earlier, Prince argued in court that cannabis did not belong among prohibited substances listed in the Drugs and Trafficking Act.Prince said there were no legitimate reasons why the government should have penal provisions in respect of cannabis use.He also pointed out that there was no evidence to show that cannabis was unsafe and killed millions. Alcohol and tobacco, on the other hand, sent many to their graves, he said."This is an equality issue. Cannabis should be treated the same as alcohol and tobacco," said the activist lawyer.He approached the Constitutional Court more than 10 years ago to argue that it was his constitutional right to use cannabis.He also tried to have the Cape Law Society admit him as an attorney but failed because he had a conviction for dagga possession.In 2001, he told the Sunday Times that marijuana was a "sacrament in the Rastafarian movement"."We eat it, we bath in it, we bake with it, we puff it from time to time," said Prince.In 2013, Prince, his wife and his daughter appeared in court for cultivating and dealing in dagga.State advocate Siphokazi Poswa-Lenotholi argued yesterday that the evidence in support of Acton and Prince's action was "weak" and a waste of the court's time.The case continues today.
