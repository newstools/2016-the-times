According to testimony:As COO, Motsoeneng was the de facto CEO of the corporation, despite there being an appointed CEO;Motsoeneng always wanted to have the final say and spoke last in meetings, saying that anyone who could not work with him should leave;He attempted to influence a deal that would have led to the Gupta family owning part of the SABC's 24-hour news channel;The State Security Agency was called in by SABC executives to investigate leaks to the media about the public broadcaster's finances; andAnyone who questioned his decision not to cover protests was asked to leave the SABC.It goes on.The EFF's Fana Mokoena summed it up best, saying: "The SABC is a microcosm of South Africa, when all that is required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing. How did this happen?"That is the question to which we profoundly hope the committee finds an answer.It is well and good to highlight all that is wrong with the SABC and its management but unless we get to how, and under whose orders, it was allowed to get so bad, the committee risks being yet another talk shop.We have to look at the abject failure to intervene of the parliamentary portfolio committee on communications. We have to look at the minister of communications who, through her silence and failure to act, has made the likes of Motsoeneng and board chairman Mbulaheni Maguvhe seemingly untouchable.Parliament must ensure that it gets to the bottom of this outrageous situation or it will be seen as being "complicit in denying 20million South Africans access to balanced news", as one SABC journalist fired by Motsoeneng said.
