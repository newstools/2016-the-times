Cope spokesman Dennis Bloem said on Sunday that the party had laid criminal charges against both Ellen Tshabalala the former chairperson of the SABC and Hlaudi Motsoeneng chief executive for corporate affairs at the public broadcaster with the police but nothing has happened to date. On 15 July 2015 we laid fraud charges against Ellen Tshabalala for misrepresenting her education qualifications case number ( CAS 461/7/2015). To date nothing has happened with this case. On the 7 October 2016 we laid corruption and fraud charges against Hlaudi Motsoeneng for selling the archives of the SABC to Multi-Choice case number (CAS 86/7/2016). To date nothing has happened with this case Bloem said.READ THIS: Accusations rain down on HlaudiHe added that the explosive evidence that former members of the SABC gave to a parliamentary ad hoc committee left Cope with no other option but to come to the suspicion that this corrupt network involved the police as well . Why is it so difficult for the police to conclude such straight forward cases? For the second time in Parliament former member of the SABC board Mr Krish Naidoo told the committee that the Multi-Choice deal was illegal. Cope believes that these cases are very serious and further believes that sufficient evidence exists to charge Ellen Tshabalala and Hlaudi Motsoeneng and put them where they belong - in jail. Cope wants to assure the Minister of Police Nathi Nhleko that we will do everything in our power to see to it that these cases end up in court. We will never get tired in fighting for justice Bloem said.
