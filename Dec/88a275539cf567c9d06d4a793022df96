It said on Friday that a proposal to campaign for the reopening of the inquest had been endorsed at a two-day meeting of the party s Augmented Central Committee. The SACP will consult with the Hani family and explore a legal route to follow in this regard. We will also campaign through political action and our 2017 commemoration of Comrade Hani s assassination will be dedicated to demanding the inquest. The SACP added that it would also continue to oppose parole for Hani s convicted killer Janusz Walu . We believe that he and his convicted late co-conspirator Clive Derby-Lewis did not make a full disclosure of the circumstances surrounding the assassination. The SACP noted the recent contradictions between Walu position and the so-called Derby-Lewis disclosure released posthumously. Derby-Lewis died an unrehabilitated convicted murderer who believed apartheid was the right policy for South Africa and that Comrade Hani had to be killed the SACP said.Clive Derby-Lewis who supplied the gun Walus used to kill Hani died last month at the age of 80 after a long battle with lung cancer.He was released on medical parole last year after doctors found that he already had stage 4 cancer. He had been serving a life prison sentence.
