MEC for transport, community safety and liaison Mxolisi Kaunda said yesterday that Monday's shooting of the Shozi brothers, Ndumiso, 27 and Thbani, 25, was a setback for the government's efforts to bring peace to the troubled region.The Shozi brothers were believed to be related to ANC strongman, taxi boss and eThekwini councillor Boy Shozi.They were ambushed and killed by unknown assailants.Their cousin, Philani Shozi, 24, who was with the brothers, escaped with gunshot wounds and is in hospital.The bereaved family is not speaking to the media.Kaunda, who has been instrumental in establishing high-level police teams to investigate the violence in the Inchanga area, said: "This comes as a setback to us as we are working flat out to bring about lasting peace in Inchanga."We need to get into the bottom of this incident and find out if it is related to the current political conflict," he said.An ANC-SACP two-a-side committee was tasked with helping the police investigation.Several arrests were made, but that has not quelled the strife brewing in the region.Kaunda said police were working around the clock to bring to book those responsible for "this callous act".The latest killings follow that of SACP member Nontsikelelo Blose, 40, and the ANC's Xolani Ngcobo, 38, who were killed 24 hours apart in August.Previous killings in Inchanga include those of the SACP's Phillip Dlamini, 68, and Bongani Hlatshwayo, 38, both killed in January, and Siyabonga Ngubo, 38, who was killed in May.
