The UK House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts published a scathing report on the project this week saying it was staggering that the project was completed before the effects of dangerous wind shear conditions were ascertained. Large commercial aircraft cannot land there safely due to wind shear sudden and unpredictable changes in wind direction.Basil Read a South African construction firm was appointed to build the airport to provide an air bridge and boost tourism to the island previously only reachable by ship.The project was backed financially by the UK government via the Department for International Development. It is staggering that the Department commissioned and completed the St Helena airport before ascertaining the effect of prevailing wind conditions on landing commercial aircraft safely at St Helena said the report. For a project of this size we would expect the Department to have applied a thorough concept design and risk management process in the early part of any engineering works to test assumptions and highlight potential operational issues such as wind shear . The Department was unwilling to tell us who was responsible for this oversight ahead of its own review into where accountability lies and until it has decided whether it will take legal action against its contractors or disciplinary action against its officials said the report.Business Day reported in October that South African airline Comair was contracted to service the island with a 10-hour return flight from Johannesburg once a week. The flights have not started due to safety concerns.Basil Read said it was not to blame for the problems adding that an aerodrome certificate was issued by Air Safety Support International a subsidiary of the UK Civil Aviation Authority.Some charter and medical evacuation flights have landed safely on the island.Other key findings made by the committee were that the UK Department for International Development: - Did not do enough to ensure it had the appropriate technical resources and competence to build the airport. - Has not yet determined the extent or cost of the remedial action required to bring the airport into commercial use.The committee said it was extremely sceptical about the Department s projected tourism figures and the island s ability to support such growth in the tourist industry .
