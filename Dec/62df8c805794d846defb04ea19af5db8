Rodney Ramagalela smashed City ahead in the seventh minute, Cole Alexander equalising with an attempted cross in 36th. Substitute Jeremy Brockie scored a 69th-minute winner from the penalty spot.High-flying Matsatsantsa would not have wanted to go into the break on a three-match winless streak.They kept themselves in contention to challenge for the PSL by fighting for every inch of their win against a Luc Eymael s feisty Polokwane.The victory saw Stuart Baxter s men from Pretoria recover from their 2-1 Telkom Knockout final disappointment against Cape Town City 11 days ago, which was followed by a 1-1 league draw away against the Capetonians on Friday night.SuperSport went to 13 games unbeaten in the league, their only defeat coming in their opening game against Platinum Stars. They drew level on 25 points with second-placed Bidvest Wits on the top of the log, though with a superior goal difference.Wits have played 13 games to SuperSport s 14. But Matsatsantsa have signalled their intent to be up near the top come the end of the season.The first half was a fascinating contest between SuperSport s organisation and structured passing pitted against Polokwane s quick, dangerous frontline and numbers going forward. The latter largely won the contest, though the scoreline was 1-1 at the break.City striker Ramagalela stunned the home side with a fine finish just after the start. United left-back Onismor Bhasera s stray pass found winger Sipho Jembula, who fed the City striker in space, Ramagalela curling a powerful shot past stranded goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse into the top-left corner.Aubrey Modiba had two chances to equalise in space on the left, skewing one wide and shooting into the legs of keeper George Chigova.When SuperSport did level it was with a touch of fortune. Alexander chased Michael Boxall s long ball to the goalline on the right and stretched for his cross, which was struck with venom and caught the wind to swerve in over Chigova s head.City could have had a second before the break, Pieterse coming for Puleng Tlolane s corner and missing, with defensive midfielder Sammy Seabi s header skimming the crossbar.Polokwane continued to trouble SuperSport early in the second half, Dean Furman giving the ball away to Ramagalela who opted to go alone, and missed the target, when he had Jabu Maluleke free inside.Thabo Mnyamane has been SuperSport s most dangerous forward this season, with five goals in all competitions.The former Tuks man cut inside and produced a thunderous strike that Chigova dealt with surprisingly comfortably.Then Mnyamane earned a free-kick, which he took, forcing a diving save from City s Zimbabwean keeper.The forward s efforts had edged an advantage for SuperSport, which paid for the Pretoria team when Reneilwe Letsholonyane was clattered down on the right of City s area by Thabang Klaas and referee Akona Makalima pointed to the spot.Brockie, on for Kingston Nkhatha from the break, slotted past Chigova into the right corner. - TMG Digital
