The ANC-allied organisation applauded the West Cape High Court s dismissal on Friday of an application by the SABC board chairman Mbulaheni Maguvhe to halt the inquiry by a parliamentary ad hoc committee.It also welcomed Judge Siraj Desai s order that Maguvhe foot the legal bill for his own legal team as well as those of the four other respondents including parliament. It is high time that individuals who are pursuing court actions on behalf of the public broadcaster and without the mandate of a well constituted and functional board fund their futile and ambitious endeavours out of their own pockets and not squander taxpayers monies said SANCO national spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu.Mahlangu expressed the hope that the ruling has paved the way for the adhoc parliamentary committee to expedite its probe leading to the logical conclusion of the matter and ultimately the dissolution of the SABC board. The public broadcaster s current leadership crisis and impasse is unprecedented and warrants decisive action to protect the image and integrity of the SABC as a global as well as continental player and a national asset he asserted. He said that undermining any committee of Parliament was tantamount to subverting Parliament as an institution and a supreme law making body to which all public entities and state owned enterprises(SOEs) accounted. Professor Maguvhe must be reminded of the tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians passed on from generation to generation which says that when you discover that you are riding a dead horse the best strategy is to dismount Mahlangu added.
