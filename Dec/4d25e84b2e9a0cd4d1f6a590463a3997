In addition party leader Jeremy Acton told the Cape Town High Court on Tuesday that prisoners with cannabis-related convictions should be released.Acton and pro-cannabis parties including activist Garreth Prince have applied to the court to have the prohibition of cannabis declared unconstitutional."We ask that all cannabis prisoners be released and that previous convictions be wiped clean '' said Acton who appeared before a full bench.Earlier Prince argued that cannabis did not belong on the Drugs and Trafficking Act. Prince said there were no legitimate reasons why government should have penal provisions in respect of cannabis use. He also pointed out that there was no evidence to show that cannabis is unsafe and had killed millions. Alcohol and tobacco on the other hand had sent many to their graves."This is an equality issue. Cannabis should be treated the same as alcohol and tobacco '' said Prince.Prince a trained lawyer dagga activist and Rastafarian approached the Constitutional Court more than 10 years ago to argue it was his constitutional right to use cannabis.He also tried to have the Cape Law Society admit him as an attorney something it would not do because he had a conviction for dagga possession.In 2001 he told the Sunday Times that dagga is a ''sacrament within the Rastafarian movement''."We eat it we bath in it we bake with it we puff it from time to time '' said Prince.In 2013 Prince his wife and daughter appeared in court for cultivating and dealing in dagga.On Tuesday morning state advocate Siphokazi Poswa-Lenotholi argued that the evidence in support of Acton and Prince's action was ''weak'' and a waste of the court's time.The evidence is a compilation of reports and articles by commissions of inquiry into cannabis from all over the world.The state wants the matter to be tabled before Parliament.The case will continue on Wednesday.TMG Digital/Sunday Times
