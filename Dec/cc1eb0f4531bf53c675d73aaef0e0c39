She disappeared and I screamed to my wife and neighbours to try and save her but the water was very strong and flowing very fast said Chauke. It was raining hard and it was almost dark and neighbours were also trying to save their possessions and their lives. Nobody paid attention to what was happening to my daughter he said.
