Chiefs had to fight their way back from goal down but such are their decrepit levels of confidence, they allowed Luc Eymael's side to equalise before Katsande pulled the proverbial rabbit from the hat.Had Chiefs not been able to extricate themselves from the quicksand they have been finding themselves in, they would have gone nine games without a win.Chiefs coach Steve Komphela would have had to refer to his kilopascal measuring instrument to see how much pressure he was under.With Chiefs' last win dating back to the 2-0 win against Ajax Cape Town on October 15, Komphela's rather lengthy lexicon would have soon run out of adjectives to describe his team's impotency and their inability to conjure a positive result. Fortunately, his midfield hardman provided Komphela with the much needed break.When Rodney Ramagalela's 30th minute shot wormed its way past Brilliant Khuzwayo and the right-hand upright, it was due reward for a side that saw little of the ball, but made the most of it when it came their way.Had Ramagalela not had a 23rd minute penalty saved by Khuzwayo after Katsande brought Puleng Tlolane down, it could have been an ugly first stanza for the under pressure AmaKhosi. Polokwane came into the game being fourth on the log with 21 points from 13 games and played like a side in the top five.They allowed Chiefs, who at times ran like headless chickens, come at them and soak up the pressure before catching them on the counter.That was the case when Tlolane was tackled illegally as Chiefs' defence was struggling. Ramagalela's atoning goal was a case of the striker being afforded too much space, something Chiefs' defence is not often renowned for.There was also the small matter of Chiefs being denied a legitimate penalty when Thabiso Semenya handled the ball in the box but referee Victor Hlungwani saw things differently.The already edgy Chiefs faithful who have endured their team's pain became apoplectic. However, they seemingly forget Chiefs often get the rub of the green when it comes to 50/50 decisions. Sometime the wheel does turn.It took Chiefs until the 62nd minute to find the equaliser, which came via Bernard Parker's header after Siphiwe Tshabalala's delightful cross.It was fitting the two senior players combined for the goal because they have abdicated their onfield responsibilities recently.Parker turned provider for Molangoane's first Chiefs goal nine minutes later when the former Bafana Bafana forward found space and put in a good cross that Molangoane blasted past the helpless George Chigova.Suddenly, there was a fluency and confidence in Chiefs' game that was last seen in their 1-all draw against SuperSport United on November 23.While they were unfortunate to lose first choice right back Ramahlwe Mphahlele to injury early in the second half, his absence went unnoticed until Tlolane rocked up with City's equaliser in the 83rd minute.It was another defensive lapse that's not often associated with Chiefs but when a team is not winning, the lack of confidence often permeates into areas that are often seen as strengths and they become weaknesses.However, the fat lady had not sung yet and Katsande still had its say. The Chiefs faithful made sure the stadium felt like it was packed to capacity.Kaizer Chiefs:Khuzwayo, Mphahlele, Mathoho, Gordinho, Khumalo, Katsande, Tshabalala, Maluleka, Molangoane, Parker, MachaSubs:Khune, Cardoso, Moleko, Ekstein, Baloyi, Katsvairo, LetlotloPolokwane City:Chigova, Tema, Semenya, Klaas, Maponyane, Seabi, Matsemela, Ramagalela, Mncwango, Tlolane, MalulekeSubs: Ndlovu, Jembula, Hlongwane, Mbonani, Ndou, Mngomezulu, PhungwayoAbsa Premiership result: Baroka FC 1-1 Golden Arrows
