"The historic ruling guarantees that the Land Claims Court will no longer endorse unlawful eviction orders but will ensure that the security of tenure of the most exploited and abused section of workers is protected said SANCO national spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu.Mahlangu called for a review of cases of farmworkers who were left homeless before the comprehensive judgment. He said that the Department of Rural Development and Land Affairs had an obligation to assist farmworkers with the review process as part of accelerating the reversal of the legacy of the infamous 1913 Land Act. Land ownership is key to addressing poverty unemployment and inequality as well as restoring the dignity of the landless and historically marginalised poor he stated. The Constitutional Court this week overturned an eviction order allowing Voorbaat farmworker Karel Snyders 54 his wife and daughter to return to their home.Snyders had dragged Ladysmith farm owner Louisa de Jager to court after she fired him and began eviction proceedings in 2008.
