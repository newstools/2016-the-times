The Bethlehem-based side were a shadow of the unit that muscled the hosts out of the Telkom Knockout Cup and at times, it seemed their minds was on the impending Christmas break. They still have a game to go before that happens when they host Cape Town City on Wednesday evening in their last match of the year.Mhango opened the scoring in the 14th minute when he latched onto Mogakolodi Ngele's superb pass from the right hand side.The Botswana international beat three markers with his searing pass before unlocking the defence with a precise pass.The best Free State Stars goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni could do was to help the ball into the right - hand corner.Mhango should have completed his brace in the 28th minute but he fluffed his chip with keeper Ngobeni at his mercy.It was as if the Stars defence had gone on holiday with the ease at which Mahlambi, Mhango and Ngele tore them apart at will.It didn't come as a surprise when Mahlambi was the second goal scorer with his 36th minute penalty, even though there was a whiff of controversy with how it was accrued.Fanele Filita tackled Mahlambi fairly in the box but referee Lwandile Mfiki had other ideas.Stars aren't Wits' bogey side for nothing and the hardworking Bokang Thlone put Thokozani Sekotlong through for an excellent 43rd minute goal.Mahlambi added his second in the 61st minute after Ngobeni parried Thulani Hlatshwayo's header into his path.Stars' misery was compounded when captain Angelo Kerspuy earned himself a 76th minute sending off for a second bookable offence.Just to show the stars weren't aligned for them, the inactive Darren Keet was asked to pull off an 85th minute double save from a Moeketsi Sekola penalty and rebound after Makhehleni Makaula was carelessly brought down in the box.It capped a night for Stars's Italian head coach Giovanni Solinas and his charges would quickly love to forget. - TMG Digital
