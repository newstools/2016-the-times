A video has surfaced of two men coming to blows at a traffic light near Pick n Pay and a few more people jumping into the fight.Ntsika Ngcuka 34 who took the video said there was traffic jam at the robots and he realised that people were fighting. I immediately took a video but I could not hear what they were arguing about. I only heard when the white guy started swearing at the two black people. It then became chaotic as motorists were throwing insults with black and white people each encouraging people of their race groups to join in and beat each other .The Herald and Weekend Post are still trying to track down the people involved in the fight.
