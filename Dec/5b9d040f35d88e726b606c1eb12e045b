Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said the man 29 had been admitted to hospital for alcohol-related issues on Saturday before the incident the next morning Christmas Day. Initial reports were that he had jumped from a first-floor window onto the roof of the Accident and Emergency Unit but it later emerged he had suffered a much worse fall from a higher floor. The man did not respond to sedation [after he was admitted] Kupelo said. He ran away from a doctor broke the window and fell from the fifth floor to the ground. Both his legs were fractured in the fall and he suffered a serious head injury. This story appeared in The Herald.
