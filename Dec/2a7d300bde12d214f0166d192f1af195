It was that blog that opened their lives to us, the public. Not just because we speculated on their every sub-tweet, but because so many people had their say on social media.As Zinhle battled the intrusion, seeing her man loved-up with someone else, she still had to be a mother and a businesswoman.No time to fit herself in, clearly.Then in June she did an interview with Anele where she spoke about getting a tattoo done.When she was going through a tough time she had a tattoo done that didn't really hurt. Later she had another tattoo done and she said it hurt. The implication being that the pain of her first tattoo wasn't as bad as the emotional turmoil that she was going through, whereas the new, small one was so sore, hurting more than her current emotional state.It was then that Zinhle let us in one a secret: she had met someone.Not only had she found time for herself, but she had allowed herself to believe in love again and fall in love.Brendon Naidoo has certainly given our girl her spark back. The two have become very vocal about their love for each other and unlike her relationship with AKA, Zinhle isn't shy to show off her man.
