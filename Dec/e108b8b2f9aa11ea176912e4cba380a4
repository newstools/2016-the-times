The two men, Willem Oosthuisen and Theo Martins Jackson, have applied for bail in the Middelburg Magistrate's Court. The prosecution has opposed the application, fearing that the men will intimidate witnesses.Investigating officer Detective Constable Dimakatso Bahula testified that Mlotshwa cried, pleading for his life, as the men threatened to burn him inside the coffin."He said they beat him all over his body with a knobkerrie and forced him into the coffin. They . threatened to put a snake in the coffin and use petrol to burn him," Bahula told the court.She described how Mlotshwa struggled to walk home because of his injuries.She said a second victim, Delton Sithole, from the same community as Mlotshwa, was also assaulted by the two accused, minutes before they encountered Mlotshwa.Giving reasons why the two accused should not be granted bail, Bahula said that another farm owner had opened a case of intimidation on Wednesday at the Blinkpan police station ."[The farmer] alleges that he has been receiving threatening texts saying that his wife will be the next in a coffin."The lawyer for the accused, John Welsh, said his clients claimed that Mlotshwa was carrying a bag of copper wires.Bahula replied: "I was not there. I wouldn't know and the victim never told me about that."Welsh said that if released on bail his clients would not interfere in the case.Last month they chose not to apply for bail, fearing for their safety if released.Welsh said that Oosthuisen and Jackson will move to a different area. The case continues today.
