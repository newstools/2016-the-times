Wits are among the favourites for the Absa Premiership title this season but have taken just a point from their last three league matches after defeats to Cape Town City and Supersport United, and a draw with Highlands Park.Next up for coach Gavin Hunt's side is a trip to Arrows tonight, a team they have enjoyed success over in Durban in the past decade.The Students' last eight visits to Abafana Bes'thende have yielded five victories and three draws, dating all the way back to 2008.Arrows last beat the Clever Boys in Durban nine years ago.Hunt is wary of his team's slump in form, though, but says the results do not reflect their performances."We have let ourselves down in the last three games. It's been poor from a results perspective, but football sometimes goes like that," said Hunt, 52. "You've got to be brave and stand up."
