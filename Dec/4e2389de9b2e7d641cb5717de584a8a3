Speaking to TshisaLive on Tuesday, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said that he was not aware of an interdict against the broadcaster in the matter."I am not aware of any court papers being served on the SABC or any judgement in any interdict being passed. I met with our legal team this morning and there was no word on this matter," Kaizer said.Kaizer added that the broadcaster would not respond to the matter until these papers were received and that it would not comment in the public sphere.Rous House Productions, who produce the popular SABC 3 drama series, issued a statement last week saying that they had met with the broadcaster to discuss a decision to cancel the show, but that the meeting was unsuccessful and they decided to turn to the courts for help."RHP has no other choice but to approach the courts with an application for an urgent interdict to stop the SABC from cancelling High Rollers. This application was served on SABC on the 7 of Dec and a court date has been set to hear the urgent case within the next week," the production house said in a statement.Attempts to contact Rous House Productions for comment were unsuccessful.
