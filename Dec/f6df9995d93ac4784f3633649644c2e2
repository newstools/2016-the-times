The men from Pretoria returned from their tough sojourn at the Fifa Club World Cup (CWC) to notch one more win of 2016 in the PSL, 1-0 against Baroka FC at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Thursday evening.Sundowns have played a lot of matches in 2016.The PSL and African champions final one a tricky comedown from losing their two matches at a rarefied height at the CWC in Japan, pitted on Thursday against desperate last-placed opponents on a wet, slippery pitch would never be so easy.Perhaps Downs coach Pitso Mosimane, who has had such a fine year his crowning, defining year so far as a coach could on this occasion, even if it goes against his policy, have given youngsters and energetic fringe players a run at Baroka.Mosimane named his full-strength team, apart from two changes, with Wayne Sandilands replacing Denis Onyango in goal and Sibusiso Vilakazi coming in for Leonardo Castro in the frontline.Nonetheless, virtually the same combination that faced Jeonduk Hyundai Motors in Osaka in the 4-1 CWC fifth-place playoff defeat eight days ago lifted themselves from a tired first half, and turned on some form of their trademark passing football in the second.Downs might have been denied victory by an incorrect offside decision when Hlompo Kekana had the ball in the net with 20 minutes left.For a team aware of how much of a backlog of fixtures they need to catch up in the second half of the season, and that every point counts, and a side who also simply just love to win, to be refused victory in that manner would have been a bitter pill to swallow.But you cannot keep this irrepressible winning machine down. Substitute Anthony Laffor always seemed to be the go-to man to break a deadlock. The Liberian produced a fine cross in the 84th minute from which Kekana, this time with no doubt about being onside, crashed in a strong header.Sundowns were a flat, disjointed and tired combination in the first half who found little energy to find a way to break down a lively Baroka.It was Baroka who had the best chance of a half where shots on goal from either side were almost non-existent, though with a touch of fortune to it.Five minutes before the break Richard Matloga was metres offside when the match officials allowed him to run free and round goalkeeper Sandilands, though in doing so the forward took himself well wide and his attempt to steer in a finish was intercepted by Ricardo Nascimento.Baroka had another good opportunity just after the break as right-back Mathari Motupa s cross found Marshall Munetsi to get up for a strong downward header that had Sandilands at full stretch. Collins Makgaka hit the loose ball wide.Downs would not have been pleased by the near-side assistant referee s decisions. After earlier allowing Matloga through, in the 69th Downs had a legitimate goal disallowed.Keagan Dolly s pass put Tau through on the right, who advanced and cut back for Kekana to stab in from eight metres, with the goal unfathomably over-ruled for offside.But now Downs were finding their legs, and Laffor was the right man to introduce with Baroka waning, soon setting up captain Kekana s winner. - TMG Digital
