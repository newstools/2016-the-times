Mandela asked the ANC's new generation to accept the burden carried with devotion by party veterans such as Oliver Tambo Moses Kotane Yusuf Dadoo JB Marks Lilian Ngoyi Florence Mophosho Kate Molale Alex La Guma Helen Joseph Joe Slovo Bram Fischer Moses Mabhida and Ruth First."It is in their name that we say to you: here are the reins of the movement - protect and guard its precious legacy; defend its unity and integrity as committed disciples of change; pursue its popular objectives like true revolutionaries who seek only to serve the nation."If we make these demands on you it is because you accepted the burden of responsibility when you decided to enter the ranks of this leading movement of fundamental change. You responded to the call of destiny to bring into reality the day when the people can indeed govern."Running like a golden thread through the decisions taken by party leaders was the need to reaffirm what the ANC has always stood for the statesman said.He cited these as:- to bring fundamental change to the lives of all South Africans especially the poor;- to recognise the actual contradictions in our society and to state them boldly the better to search for their resolution;- to avoid steps that further worsen social conflict; and- to build our new nation by continually and consciously exorcising the demon of tribalism racism and religious intolerance.
