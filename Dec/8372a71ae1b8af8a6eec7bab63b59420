ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said it was understood that local authorities were in pursuit of one of the vehicles when it collided with the second vehicle. ER24 paramedics along with other services arrived on the scene and found both wrecked vehicles in the middle of the road. Upon closer inspection paramedics found four occupants seated inside one of the light motor vehicles while the driver of the second vehicle was found walking around on the scene. On assessment paramedics found a man lying trapped in the driver's seat of the vehicle. Unfortunately the man had already succumbed to his multiple fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead on the scene Meiring said. He said the wife of the deceased was found lying trapped in the front passenger seat of the vehicle while a boy (6) and girl (8) were found seated in the back. All three had sustained moderate injuries. Rescue services had to use the jaws-of-life equipment to free the woman from the vehicle. Once freed paramedics treated the three patients and thereafter transported them to Pelonomi Provincial Hospital for further care Meiring said.The driver of the second vehicle escaped without injury and was taken into custody he said.
