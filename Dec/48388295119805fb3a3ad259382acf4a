Speaking on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the signing into law of the country s democratic constitution the EFF said that it was a fact that in the past five years under the rule of of President Jacob Zuma the democratic ideal of the rule of law had been eroded. On two occasions the ANC government violated the rule of law by ignoring rulings of the Constitutional court. First was in relation to the Nkandla court judgement which ruled that Zuma has failed to uphold and protect the constitution. This should imply that he must step down from the high calling and office of President yet he did not. Secondly it was in relation to the matter of the Sudanese President Al Bashir. The court ruled that he should be arrested and handed over to the International Criminal Court and the ANC Zuma government ignored the court.READ THIS: Use Chapter 9 institutions: Zuma urges South Africans On both occasions even despite the merits of the Al Bashir matter the ANC government set a precedent that the highest court in the land can be ignored thus eroding the rule of law the EFF said. It said it was also a fact that in the last 20 years the country had witnessed a gradual corruption of state institutions and corporations. This has taken historic and unbearable proportions under the ANC Zuma regime in particular considering the Public Protector State of Capture Report. It is a fact that Zuma has relegated the running of the country from appointment of ministers to CEOs and board members of state institutions and corporations to a foreign family of the Guptas who are also his personal business partners the EFF asserted. The ANC government's failure to uphold the constitution must be seen as a marker of moral degeneration and degradation on their part it added.
