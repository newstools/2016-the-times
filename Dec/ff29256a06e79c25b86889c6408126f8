It means that Thabo Senong s side relinquish the title they won three years ago in Lesotho after they were second best to the more powerful Zambians on the day. Goals in either half from Kenneth Kalunga and Boyd Musonda earned Zambia the win, while Amajita had equalised through Kabelo Seriba. But they can have little argument about the result having had to scramble in defence on numerous occasions to keep the Zambians at bay. Zambia took the lead in the eighth minute after a period of concerted pressure as Kalunga ghosted into the box unmarked to fire the Young Chipolopolo ahead. South Africa were level on 41 minutes when Luther Singh s free-kick struck the crossbar and with Zambia goalkeeper Mangani Banda unable to clear adequately, Seriba crashed the ball home. But Zambia grabbed the winner five minutes from time when Musonda turned the ball home and they were able to hold on for the victory. - TMG Digital
