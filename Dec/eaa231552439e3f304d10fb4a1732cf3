Mahlangu said that the resurgence of racism which had recently been manifested through racist Facebook rants vicious assaults including verbal racial abuse discrimination against black learners at Pretoria Girls High school abduction assault and the forcing of Victor Mlotshwa into a coffin was the antithesis of reconciliation unity nation-building and social cohesion. This cancerous spirit has the potential to reverse the collective gains that the country has made since the dawn of freedom and democracy he warned. He said that the destructive life-force must be confronted wherever it raised its ugly head and the perpetrators of human rights violations as well as racial abuse marginalised and severely punished . An inclusive economy will lay the foundation for peaceful co-existence and unity Mahlangu added.
