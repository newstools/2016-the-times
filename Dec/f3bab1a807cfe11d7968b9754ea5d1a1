Seema and John Maduka were appointed as caretakers coaches after Serame Letsoaka stepped down in the beginning of last month and as he explained this week the arrangement has been on a game-by-game basis.The duo have managed an unbeaten run of five games at the helm and word from Bloemfontein is that the results have strengthened the possibility of the two coaches keeping the job at least until the end of the season.Celtic are 12th on the table and a victory against Ajax Cape Town at Dr Molemela Stadium on Saturday would move Seema s dream a step closer to reality. Because of the kind of start we had I think if we can finish (the year) in the top eight bracket then I think that we can be in a good position Seema said. It would be great if we can make sure that we push into the top eight bracket before the (Christmas) break. After that I do not know what will happen but if it is still us (coaching the team) again then we will have to regroup and make new goals again (in the new year). If we can improve the position we found the team in which was position 14 then I would say we are moving in the right direction if we can improve on that before the break. Celtic have won seven points from their last five matches in games against Kaizer Chiefs (0-0) Highlands Park (1-1) SuperSport United (0-0) Baroka FC (2-1 win) and Polokwane City (0-0).After Saturday s encounter against Ajax Celtic s remaining fixture of the year will be against Seema s former club Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday.
