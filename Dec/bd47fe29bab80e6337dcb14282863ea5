Babes won the title alongside Muvhango heartthrob Zwelethu Dube."I'm not happy that I lost. I thank God, he said to me my child today you are going to be sick, here are the tables I'm not lying, stay at home and don't go to Mzansi cause you are going to embarrass yourself," she said.Ntando added that even though she's happy for Babes, it was painful to lose.Watch Ntando having a moan here:A video posted by Ms Ntando Fleekiswa Duma (@dumantando) on Dec 6, 2016 at 12:32pm PST
