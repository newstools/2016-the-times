This comes after the upmarket Clifton eatery faced a searing public backlash for allegedly racially profiling customers as two blacks on a till slip. The drama exploded on social media earlier this week after Scott Magethuka tweeted an image of the slip.It has prompted widespread outrage with some calling the establishment racist. The restaurant is part-owned by Chris Coutroulis owner of Sandton nightclub Taboo and husband of former Miss South Africa Vanessa Carreira. The Zimbabwean waiter who served Magethuka has since been suspended pending an inquiry. He later apologised saying he regretted the incident. But the ANCYL convenor in the Cape Metro Unathi Tshotwana insists that restaurant management should have contacted Magethuka personally and apologised. Why do their tills have [an option of] two blacks? When you go to a restaurant there is table one table two table three so how do you have that thing on your system that says identify people by the colour of their skin? asked Tshotwana. He said they didn t only want an apology but wanted to understand the system used by the restaurant. We want to know if two white people order [does the receipt] say they are white people? He said they have requested a meeting with management by no later than 1 pm on Friday. If the establishment fails to meet with them Tshotwana said they have vowed to fill the restaurant with members wearing ANC t-shirts bearing the slogan "Stop Racism''. It will be a very painful end of the year for them because we know all the events that they have lined up. It will be very painful because they will be disturbed he said. When TMG Digital phoned the restaurant for comment on Wednesday a woman picked up. She declined to identify herself or comment. - TMG Digital/The Times
