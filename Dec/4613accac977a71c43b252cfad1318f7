Kabila is accused of clinging to power in the minerals-rich country despite his second term of office coming to an end on December 20. According to the DRC s constitution a president can only serve two terms. Protests in Cape Town turned violent on Monday as police used stun grenades to disperse protesters. But there was no such drama in Durban as the small gathering marched on the city hall. Mr President [Kabila] his term is already over but he s forcing himself to be there. He must respect our constitution because it s the supreme law of the country. We are tired of his regime. He must leave and go one of the marchers Rev Rafael Bahebwa said. Bahebwa called on the South African government to intervene. We are here because South Africa supports him. The same South Africa that supports him must make sure he's out of there. We are not here to fight for presidency but we need the regime to change he said. - TMG Digital/The Times
