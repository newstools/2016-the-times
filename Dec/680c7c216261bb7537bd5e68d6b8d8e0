Model Qandeel Baloch, who shot to fame for her provocative selfies that polarised the conservative Muslim country, was strangled in July by her brother Muhammad Waseem. He said she had brought shame on the family and confessed to his crime in a press conference after his arrest.The model was demeaned by her detractors, but fans praised her for daring to challenge social norms by appearing in videos that by Western standards appear tame.Waseem was produced before a court in the central city of Multan on Monday along with his cousin Haq Nawaz, who police said was an accomplice, though the nature of his involvement was unclear.A second indicted accomplice, taxi driver Abdul Basit, is on bail."Judge Muhammad Saeed Raza adjourned the hearing until December 8," a government prosecutor told AFP.The accused pleaded not guilty.Some of Baloch's more notorious acts included offering to perform a striptease for the Pakistani cricket team, and donning a plunging scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.She also posed for selfies with a high-profile mullah in an incident that saw him swiftly rebuked by the religious affairs ministry.Waseem told the press conference he was not remorseful over what he did, calling his sister's behaviour "intolerable".Her murder reignited calls for action against honour killings, in which a victim is killed by a relative, who could subsequently be pardoned by another family member under Pakistan law.
