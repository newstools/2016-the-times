Minnie surprised fans when she shared a picture on social media on Monday showing off her impressive bling, confirming that she is officially a taken woman. While the entire country has reacted with excitement over the news - one person who isn't in a celebratory mood is Cassper Nyovest. Everyone knows that the rapper is completely besotted with Minnie, and has previously even said that he would marry Minnie given the chance. Shortly after Minnie shared the news, Cassper took to Twitter to express his devastation. "I'm devastated!!! I don't want to talk to nobody!!! I'm switching my phone off for the rest of the day!!! 5 days before my birthday bro?," he tweeted. During an interview with TshisaLIVE earlier this year, Cassper admitted that Minnie had friendzoned him on numerous occasions, but he was determined to win over her heart. allowfullscreen Askies Cassper!
