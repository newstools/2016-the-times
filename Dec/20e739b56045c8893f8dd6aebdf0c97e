 The time for picketing and marches against racism is over spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize said adding that we must jail racists and change the ownership structure of the economy .Mkhize s call comes against the background of an increased number of racist outbursts and racial profiling in public spaces restaurants schools beaches etc . This signals a resurgence of racial arrogance that once again proclaims white supremacy with bravery Mkhize stated. These racist incidences can no longer be classified as pockets of incidents but they show a deeper underlying racial hatred that continues to exist in our society. The ANC in the Western Cape has called Saldanha Bay municipality s blocking of access roads to the beachfront and giving access cards to residents in the area racist while the league s eThikwini branch may pursue criminal charges against after Ben Sasonof who posted a picture on a crowded Durban beachfront on Facebook and said: "Eh eh Wena must have smelt like the inside of Zuma's a**hole".Mkhize linked the arrogance shown by racists to the fact that the ownership structure of capital and the share in the economy of the country continues to be predominantly white . The arrogance of racists is feed by the belief that their wealth coupled with white privilege they continue to receive makes them a superior race. To tackle this Mkhize vowed the league would relentlessly dedicate its energy in ensuring that the ANC-led government passes laws that will pull the plug on the main sources of white privilege white power and white arrogance .
