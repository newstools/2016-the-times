"This is being done to mislead the public " IPID spokesman Moses Dlamini told The Times."We are not concerned by this in as far as the veracity of the allegations."The concern is that people in high office are going to this extent to falsely implicate people in wrongdoing."It is the same pattern that we have seen since the rendition saga began. It is being repeated by the very same characters " Dlamini said.The Mail and Guardian reports that an affidavit has been submitted to Bedfordview police by Gauteng Hawks boss major-general Prince Mokotedi.Mokotedi alleges that McBride Sibiya and O Sullivan conspired to murder him and Hawks boss lieutenant general Mthandazo Ntlemeza.He further claims they planned to use information gathered on Duduzani Zuma president Jacob Zuma s son to mobilise the community to revolt and pressure the President to quit office the report says.He asserts their intention was to "destabilise the security forces of the country and to oust the president of the country through popular revolt".Earlier this month Business Day reported that Police Minister Nathi Nhleko s hopes of getting an inquiry that would allow him to suspend McBride from Ipid fizzled when Parliament s portfolio committee on police failed to deliver.Nhleko is pursuing McBride over his handling of a report into the rendition of Zimbabweans even though the National Prosecuting Authority has withdrawn charges against the Ipid head on the matter.- TMG Digital/The Times
