Figures on marriage and divorce trends released by Stats SA earlier this year show there were 24689 applications for divorce in 2014. This was an increase of 804 (3.4%) from the previous year, which saw 23885 divorces processed.According to clinical psychologist Cathrin Venter, the festive period is trying for couples."There's a lot of unfaithfulness in December, because people tend to drink more," she said."There is alcohol and substance abuse. People drink more because they had to hold back during the year and then take advantage of the festive period."There have also been instances physical abuse occurs as a result."Venter says that she has seen an influx in couples coming for counselling over the past three weeks."People who would speak to each other through their children or in other ways throughout the year at this time are forced to actually speak to one another now," she said.Durban psychologist Rakhi Bee-krum agrees, saying as a result of businesses winding down at this time of year people have more time to be aware of their state of mind."Issues that are ignored during the year sometimes come to a head during the festive season and couples become realistic about whether the marriage can work."Little issues that are easy to overlook at other times in the year when you see each other briefly in the mornings and evenings are difficult to ignore when you are in each other's space all the time," Beekrum said.But the darker side of the silly season is not limited to couples, with individuals also likely to experience a tough time."By December many people are feeling physically and emotionally tired from a busy year, and this may make them more susceptible to feelings of depression," says Marthe Viljoen of the SA Federation of Mental Health."The festive period can also be stressful for people for whom seeing their families for long hours is difficult due to complicated relationships, or for people who want to be with their families and friends but cannot due to financial pressure or distance."It can also be difficult for people who have lost loved ones," Viljoen said.The Lifeline counselling line is contactable on 0861-322-322
