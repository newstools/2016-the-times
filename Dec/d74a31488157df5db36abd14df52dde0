The investigation targeting members of the 2006 World Cup organising committee, including German football legend Franz Beckenbauer, has been expanded to include Urs Linsi, the former secretary-general of world football's governing body Fifa, the office of Switzerland's attorney-general said.The searches were carried out in connection with a probe launched last year into allegations of fraud, criminal mismanagement, money laundering and misappropriation connected with the awarding of the 2006 World Cup.The investigation initially targeted Beckenbauer, along with three organising committee members.The attorney-general's office said yesterday that "a further suspect is Urs Linsi", who until last week was serving as president of a small Zurich bank.It added that the house searches were linked to "a payment of 6.7-million made in April 2005 by the German Football Association".
