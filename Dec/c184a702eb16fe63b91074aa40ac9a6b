Family spokesperson Sipho Makhabane told TshisaLIVE that Sfiso died on Monday morning after he was rushed to hospital on Sunday night.Makhabane said Sfiso had kidney failure and had been complaining that he felt "weak".Just hours before Sfiso's death was confirmed, his wife, Ayanda, shared a heart-warming picture of the two of them together and encouraged other couples to celebrate their love for each other."How I wish couples could spend enough time praying and covering their marriages and families with the blood of Jesus, clothing their marriages with the full armour of God. Be careful, young couples, the number-one mission in the kingdom of darkness in destroying marriages and happy homes," she wrote.Ayanda said women should take control and "not let the devil enter into your marriages"."When your partner is spiritually weak, stand in the gab and fight for your families zithandwa. The calls I'm getting lately about broken marriages breaks my heart and annoys me. That is why I'm sharing this," she added.A photo posted by Ayanda Ncwane (@ayandancwane) on Dec 4, 2016 at 6:38am PST
