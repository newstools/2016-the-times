Umuziwabantu Municipality Ward 3 councillor Alwin Ace Houston was gunned down in Harding on Thursday evening during a community meeting to appoint members of a steering committee for a pending project in his ward on the south coast.Houston s killing follows that of ward candidate Bongani Skhosana who was killed in July on the eve of local government elections. He had been was transporting scholars in his minibus when unknown gunmen opened fire killing him in full view of the children.Skhosana was replaced by fellow ANC member Sonengaliphi Maphumulo who is still under guard.ANC spokesman in KwaZulu-Natal Mdumiseni Ntuli said on Friday the party was "lost for words after yet another killing". People just kill others in full view of the public. The elections are over now why do we continue killing our comrades? That cannot be right."We are sad because this was also a community activist."We condemn this and we hope the police will do their job in apprehending the assailants said Ntuli.Umuziwabantu mayor Dixie Nciki who comes from the same ward as Houston said they were devastated by his death. It just leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Comrade Ace was not even a confrontational politician. He worked for the people and died working for the people. He recently oversaw the election of his ward committee which went well. I m told he was in a meeting with members of the same ward committee where they were electing a steering committee to oversee the appointment of community members in an upcoming developmental project in the ward said Nciki.Nciki said Houston was the only minority member representing a very key community sector in his council. He lived for the poor she said.KwaZulu-Natal premier Willies Mchunu recently appointed a commission of inquiry into political killings after nearly two dozen councillors from several political parties were killed between January to August this year.Police are yet to respond to queries about the killing.- TMG Digital/Durban Newsroom
