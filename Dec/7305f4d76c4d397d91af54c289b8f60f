In a post on Facebook Nonhlanhla Mashaba said that Safa have failed to honour a South African soccer giant .She pointed to her father s record of only six defeats in 44 games in his three stints as Bafana coach.Nonhlanhla Mashaba s post read: I still wait for the day when the South African Football Association will honor one of the soccer giants of our beloved country. You are the ONLY legend who was a coach of a team while being captain of the team at the very same time [Orlando Pirates in the 1970s] and went on to win a Cup Final in your hay days!!! [sic]. You are the longest serving coach at SAFA with the best and unbeaten record!!! And you have done exceptionally well with the junior national teams!!! And you have pushed development in this country. You are the first coach to win the Cosafa Cup three times and the first coach to beat Brasil!!! [sic in the 2000 Olympics with the SA U-23s]. The list goes on!!! You contributed SO MUCH to this Association and the country and yet SAFA doesn t even have a picture of you on their museum wall. And now they fire you for a tantrum you threw that even the Maurinio s [Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho] throw. Mashaba was dismissed by Safa on Thursday following a disciplinary hearing. The hearing was into an incident that preceded his post-match TV interview for a 2-1 World Cup qualifying victory against Senegal in Polokwane on November 12 which was caught on camera where he angrily gestured at Safa president Danny Jordaan. - TMG Digital
