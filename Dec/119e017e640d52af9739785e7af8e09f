Called to brief the police committee on recent incidents detailed in the media Nhleko tried to avoid answering questions about the ongoing saga between himself and Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head Robert McBride saying this was still subject to Parliamentary processes. He requested that the committee institute an inquiry into McBride.He said he did not want to discuss the issue because "we wouldn't want to deal with it outside the directives of Parliament. We feel that any discussion outside of the designated processes borders on unfair legal process and we will wait to be called to make input when the committee deals with that."DA MP Zak Mbhele however said the meeting had been called "precisely" to discuss among other things the issues around McBride.Nhleko however said that recent reports that his alleged girlfriend had received R30 million in state funding and reports around acting police commissioner Khomotso Pahlane's multi-million rand house were "sinister attempts to tarnish the work that we do".He said that there were "innuendos and mudslinging and jostling for position".He said rumours were swirling that the Claasen board of inquiry into Riah Piyega's fitness to hold office would soon be made public."Now if that report says she is not fit then it means that someone stands a chance to fill that position so you will find people trying to discredit and rubbish certain things."He called claims that Pahlane had paid for his home from the proceeds of crime "ludicrous" and said they were without a "scientific" calculation."How do you just look at a house and say you can't afford it on your salary?"Questioned by the committee chair Francois Beukman whether he had faith in Pahlane he said "indeed I do".He called reports that the Civilian Secretariat for Police had paid R30 million to an NGO run by a woman believed to be his girlfriend "lies" adding: "You need to ask why has the lie been told? At what price and for whose benefit?" ANC MPs on the committee appeared to share some of Nhleko's fear with Livhuwani Mabija saying there was a "very dangerous serpent under the grass causing all of this trouble. There are these attacks on the integrity of the minister and the acting national police commissioner no matter how good they are."Her colleague Angie Moelebatsi asked about recent utterances about the police by "right wing NGOs and foreign citizens".Nhleko said while he wasn't sure who the serpent was and could not name the NGOs "if you want to undermine democracy and economic confidence you must undermine the police".TMG Digital/Parliamentary Team
