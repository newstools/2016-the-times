Kim Taylor customer care Leader for the Flight Centre Travel Group said travellers should be particularly watchful when attending events visiting popular tourist spots using public transport walking around in large crowds and visiting places of worship. Travellers should also check with their concierge or local tourist information centre what security related precautions they should be taking she says.The UK Italy and Portugal are among the popular destinations that South Africans will be travelling to this festive season she said.The US State Department issued a travel alert for Europe last week citing credible information that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or Da'esh) al-Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan terrorist attacks in Europe with a focus on the upcoming holiday season and associated events .The alert expires on February 20 2017.It warned that travellers should take precautions throughout Europe.Fortunately nothing came of the alert that the US embassy issued during Ramadan in South Africa.Nevertheless Taylor advised South Africans travelling to Europe to take the precaution of ensuring that they have the contact details of the South African government representation in their destination country should they find themselves in a difficult situation. Travellers to Europe should also pay attention to the news and specific travel alerts to ensure that they are well informed of the safety risks in the country or countries they intend to visit."We would also advise that visitors to Europe this Christmas allow for additional time to check in at airports and ports of entry as there may be additional security checks and delays."
