Nelson Kgwete from the department said "the South African government issued a statement on 13 October announcing the arrival in South Africa of Dr Riek Machar"."Dr Riek Machar is still in South Africa and the South African government is taking care of him given his profile."Kgwete added: "South Africa reiterates her commitment to work with the government and people of South Sudan in search of peace stability and development".Machar fled the country in August first to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Reuters this week quoted a regional political consultant as saying Machar was being kept "basically under house arrest" near Pretoria with his movements restricted and his phone calls monitored and controlled.South Sudan on Thursday marks three years since civil war broke out AFP reports. Internal rivalries erupted as President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy Machar of plotting a coup leading to violence that has left tens of thousands dead and more than 2.5 million people displaced. AFP said UN human rights experts warned two weeks ago of a nation on the brink of catastrophe saying ethnic cleansing was under way in several areas of the country as well as mind-boggling levels of sexual violence.
