He is likely to get another run on Tuesday night when Wits face a difficult away day at Maritzburg United where a draw would take them top of the table for 24 hours at least.Mahlambi returned from 10 months on the sidelines with a serious knee injury to put in a Man of the Match performance in Wits 3-1 win over Free State Stars on Saturday terrorising the visiting defence with his pace and skill on the ball.His two goals one from the penalty-spot were a reminder of his potency and there is no doubt he has sharpened a Wits attack that had looked blunt in a four-game winless run prior to Stars victory.Hunt used the 19-year-old initially on the wing before moving him to his preferred central striker role where he looked the most dangerous and believes that his partnership with English forward James Keene when the latter is re-signed in January is his best combination.But that is looking too far ahead for now he is preparing to face a Maritzburg side that are unbeaten in their last four games and look more relaxed under caretaker coach Fadlu Davids. Maritzburg for me I think are the most improved side in the league Hunt told reporters. I think they have been fantastic this year all credit to them."They made some good signings. We are under no illusion when we go down there they always put a good fight."It has always been difficult for us there. Difficult perhaps but Wits have a superb record against United winning seven of their last eight meetings with the KwaZulu-Natal side.Unusually for the PSL there has not been a draw between these two teams in nearly five years.And you have to go back to 2009 for the one and only time Maritzburg have ever claimed a home victory over Wits.United earned a battling 0-0 draw at Platinum Stars this past weekend to extend their unbeaten run to four games which Davids feels is a point well earned and will also be able to bolster their defence with the return from suspension of centre-back Kwanda Mngonyama."We have to keep our feet on the ground improve and take each game as it comes " Davids said.United may be welcoming back one of their stalwart players but Wits have lost one of theirs as captain Thulani Hlatshwayo sits out the game having reached four yellow cards this season. - TMG Digital
