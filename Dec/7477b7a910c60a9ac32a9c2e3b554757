Lebogang Manyama s header and second goal of the match past goalkeeper Darren Keet in the last of three minutes of injury time at Bidvest Stadium, almost with the last touch of the game, saw new PSL team City earn another big scalp in the PSL this season.An injury-hit Bidvest Wits would have thought they had done enough to earn a draw having twice fought back from a goal down to earn 2-2 scoreline going into injury time of an unlikely top-three in the table clash.Goals from Roland Putsche in the 14th minute for City, then Bongani Khumalo answering for Wits in the 33rd, saw the teams go into the break at 1-1 in a fast-paced game.Manyama put the Cape side ahead again profiting from Darren Keet s goalkeeping error (57th), but again Wits fought back through Eleazar Rodgers s penalty (60th).Wits have been struck with injuries, and it showed.Without their central defensive pairing of captain Thulani Hlatshwayo (broken finger) and Buhle Mkhwanazi (broken nose), and suspended left-back Sifiso Hlanti, a rejigged defence looked solid overall, but unsteady in crucial moments.Wits had new player from Jomo Cosmos Pentjie Zulu at left-back, started this week s signing Siboniso Gaxa at right-back, with Nazeer Allie moving inside to partner Khumalo in central defence.City took the early lead when Aubrey Ngoma turned on the edge of the area and used his skill to beat Khumalo down the left, then chipped perfectly for Putsche free on the far side, who could calmly steer his half-volley past Keet.Wits showed they were dangerous from headers at crosses and Elias Pelembe s accurate corners.Eleazar Rodgers s header looped onto the side-netting, then new right-back signings Siboniso Gaxa forced a save from Walters from a Pelembe corner.From another Pelembe corner Khumalo got free of the defence to power in a classic, trademark header for the 2010 World Cup Bafana Bafana centreback.The goals for both teams in the second half came in a somewhat farcical three-minute-spell.First Putche lobbed speculatively ahead towards the edge of Wits area as Keet came out and attempted to hoof clear, but missed under the close attention of Lebogang Manyama, allowing the speedy City man through to tap into an open goal.Within a minute Wits also lobbed forward, Mogakolodi Ngele s pace seeing him beat Shuaib Walters to the ball and round the City keeper, who held the forward back.Referee Thando Ndzandzeka pointed to the spot, and Rodgers slotted to the right of Walters.In the 88th Wits substitute Gabadinho Mhango s lob flashed across goal, coming within inches.But in added time Wits makeshift defence gave way again, this time allowing Manyama free to head in Bhongolwethu Jayiya s cross for a brace to the City forward. - TMG Digital/ TMG Sport
