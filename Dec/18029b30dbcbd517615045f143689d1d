Shami Harichunder spokesman for water authority Umgeni Water said on Thursday that restrictions linked to the ongoing drought would be in place in Durban Ballito Pietermaritzburg and other parts of the province "to varying degrees".He said that water demand generally increased by as much as 50% daily during December so it was important that holidaymakers reduced their consumption as much as possible."A readiness plan has been implemented to handle potential increase in demand during the coming holidays " he said.Dam levels across the province were still low despite recent rains. The four main dams in the Mgeni system - Midmar Albert Falls Nagle and Inanda - were most affected."Two seasons of above-average rainfall are required to make a noticeable difference to the levels of Midmar and Albert Falls dams. If this does not occur Midmar and Albert Falls dams will continue to reduce in levels. Additional restrictions would then be required to prevent possible failure " said Harichunder.Midmar Dam is currently at 53% Albert Falls Dam at 27% Nagle Dam at 68% and Inanda Dam 66%.-TMG Digital/Durban Newsroom
