So say economists and the National Credit Regulator.People have been warned not to blow their bonuses as the frenzy of the silly season approaches.The regulator's Mpho Ramapala said: "History has shown us that bonuses present a great temptation to [people] to continue buying things that they didn't plan for."We strongly encourage people to stop, do a budget and plan their spending carefully, especially as January, with all its expenses, is just around the corner."Ramapala said that of the country's 24million credit active consumers, 9.67million are in debt.Ramapala has advised consumers to take credit only with credit providers registered with the NCR.Economist Tinashe Chuchu said that regardless of the economic situation, people still overspend over the festive season."It's not that in December they now forget that they have to pay bills."It's tradition that regardless of the economic situation, people will always spend during the Christmas season, and maybe just cut on a few luxuries."Economist Azar Jamine said the level of household disposable income had diminished from the third quarter of the year to the fourth quarter and was at its lowest level in a decade."The spending over the Christmas season is going to be tighter than what we have been used to."Jamine said the danger of overspending lay in the possibility of people being without a job in the coming year, which was going to be economically tough. - Additional reporting by TMG Digital
