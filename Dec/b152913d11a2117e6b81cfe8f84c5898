"We assisted 48 wounded people and carried 16 others who were killed in the blast," said Abdikadir Abdirahman Adem, director of Mogadishu's AMIN ambulance service.Mogadishu residents described a huge blast that could be heard across the city and a plume of smoke that rose above the skyline.A spokesman for the city adminstration, Abdifatah Omar Halane, confirmed the blast but gave a lower toll of "nearly 10" killed. He said investigations were underway.The Al-Qaeda aligned Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility in a statement distributed on its Telegram messaging account.It said the target was a military base close to the port and claimed to have killed "nearly 30". The group frequently exaggerates the number killed in its attacks.The Shabaab is fighting to overthrow the internationally-backed government of Somalia and regularly stages deadly attacks on government, military and civilian targets in the capital and elsewhere in the war-torn country.The attack took place close to the entrance to Mogadishu's port."The bomber targeted a civilian area, there were porters and other small scale traders in the area when the blast occurred," said Ibrahim Mohamed, a senior police officer.The attack comes as Somalia is in the process of electing a new government with the much-delayed presidential vote due on December 28.
