"The baseless fraud charges filed against a sitting Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan during October 2016 and many other pending investigations against the President and senior members of government ostensibly on allegations of corruption theft fraud and other heinous crimes signifies that South Africa is facing a constitutional crisis said Mbulelo Jolwana president of the society. These cases come at a time when the country continues to face the threat of a serious economic downgrade with far-reaching consequences for our collective future he said speaking on behalf of the Council of The Cape Law Society.While the charges against Gordhan were withdrawn speculation abounds about another probe into whether he broke the law as a former head of the South African Revenue Service (SARS). The Cape Law Society views these developments with great concern and trepidation and calls on the Office of the NDPP not to do anything relating to the Finance Minister that further undermines the good standing of this office and the country at large. This is vital to the rule of law and constitutional democracy said Jolwana.This did not mean that Gordhan was above the law he cautioned. We believe that there is a sound rational basis for the President to launch an investigation into the conduct of the NDPP during the period leading up to and including the filing of the charge against Minister Gordhan and its subsequent withdrawal he said. We urge the NDPP to submit to such an investigation by an independent and objective group of people while maintaining a measure of decorum and integrity throughout he said.
