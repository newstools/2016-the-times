He said it was alleged that the group of rowdy - and possibly drunk - people who had brought in an injured colleague had become involved in an argument with clinic staff members.It is believed that the group had been attending a Christmas year-end party where alcohol was served. As the argument escalated the group began attacking the health worker as well as his colleague. They were joined by more revellers from the party. Clinic security tried to intervene but were outnumbered by the attackers. Fortunately other security officers who had been passing by stopped and also got involved in trying to diffuse the situation. They were also joined by SAPS members who arrested some of the alleged attackers Dhlomo s spokesperson Sam Mkhwanazi said. Two health workers sustained injuries with one having to receive medical attention he said. The clinic s main gate was damaged and ripped off from the rails by the attackers. Repairs to the gate are currently under way to ensure the safety of staff since the facility is providing a 24-hour service.Reacting to the incident on Saturday Dhlomo said: We are alarmed and quite frankly disgusted by this incident. We will not tolerate any form of behaviour that threatens the safety and wellbeing of health professionals and health facility support staff who render such important work. In fact the life-saving work that these people do is sacrosanct and should never be interfered with by anybody. We therefore call upon society to help protect our staff at all times.
