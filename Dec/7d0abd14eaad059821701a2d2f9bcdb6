The veteran midfielder played in the 2010 World Cup 2009 Fifa Confederations Cup and in the African Champions League among other prestigious events and he says it will be a special moment for him if he takes to the field against Japanese side Kashima Antlers in the quarterfinals of the Club World Cup on Sunday. This one is the big one especially for my club career Modise said. This is the biggest one and to be among the few teams that are the best in the world is every player s dream. And to be here with Mamelodi Sundowns especially with the quality players we have and the young players that we have that have aspirations of going overseas it is very interesting. This is every player s dream Modise said.Modise said Kashima Antlers will not be a closed book as they watched the host team beat New Zealand side Auckland City 2-1 in Club World Cup opener on Thursday.The 33-year-old former Orlando Pirates player said watching that game on Thursday gave the Brazilians an opportunity to run the rule over their opponents and figure out exactly what makes them tick. We know what we are up against but I am not too sure whether they know what they are up against. We have got a few tricks up our sleeves and we have good players as well who want to do well for the team. TMG Digital
