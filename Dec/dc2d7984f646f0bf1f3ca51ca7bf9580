 video The footage was posted on social media by a former pupil of the school which has just made international headlines because of a bullying video that went viral on Monday.Jessica Shelver spokesperson for Western Cape MEC of Education Debbie Schafer told TMG Digital that the second video was brought to the department s attention a few hours ago. We are again shocked by the violent nature of the video. Behaviour like this in our schools is unacceptable and must be dealt with as a priority. As such the District Director and School Circuit Manager have called an emergency meeting with the School Management Team. This meeting began at 1pm. We will be in a better place to comment once the meeting has concluded she said.The video shows a large schoolgirl in a blue and white uniform swearing at a smaller classmate and pushing her around. Don t walk away don t walk away shouts the larger girl in Afrikaans.She grabs the victim s ponytail yanks her head sideways and then rains punches to her face and head.The fight is temporarily halted when a larger male pupil grabs the bully around the neck and separates the two.The department is already taking action in response to the first viral video. A disciplinary hearing has been scheduled on Thursday against a schoolgirl who smashed her knee into the face of a crying Grade 8 classmate and then punched her in the head.The victim who was injured is receiving counselling. Her parents have laid a charge of assault against the bully who is scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday. The parents of the perpetrator have informed us that they have voluntarily removed their daughter from the school. The school will however still conduct the disciplinary hearing Shelver told TMG Digital on Monday.
