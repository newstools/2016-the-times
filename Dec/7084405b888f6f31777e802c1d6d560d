The 36-year-old former Highveld Lions captain is accused of grabbing and slapping a 14-year-old pupil in Pinelands on September 7.Tsolekile also made headlines this year when he was banned from cricket for 12 years for match fixing.He was scheduled to appear in the Goodwood Magistrate's Court yesterday, but his senior counsel, Mafu Masina, told the court the cricketer was too sick to attend the hearing.During Tsolekile's court appearance last month Masina asked for a postponement in order to make representations to the prosecution.The court issued a warrant for Tsolekile, which will be held over until his next court appearance on January 20.He is also required to furnish the court with a medical certificate confirming that he was too ill to attend yesterday's hearing.Masina did not divulge what the outcome of the representation to state prosecutors had been.The victim of Tsolekile's alleged assault is a pupil at Pinelands High School.The boy was shouting at passing cars outside the school when he was apparently assaulted by Tsolekile.The child was dropped off at the school and received medical attention for his injuries.The cricketer denies assaulting the pupil.Masina said Tsolekile only took the child into the school to report "what they had been doing".Tsolekile is free on a warning.
