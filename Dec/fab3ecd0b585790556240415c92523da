According to a statement issued on Thursday afternoon the decision to sell the 94-year old golf course that overlooks Durban s beachfront was taken at a special general meeting held on Wednesday by the Durban Country Club s Trust."This decision was not reached lightly. However prudent business practices were supported by the majority of members - this was the best decision."Pascale van Maris CEO of the Durban Country Club said: This should not be seen as a loss but rather as an opportunity to streamline the overall offering of the club - such that there is a renewed relevance for both the existing members as well as a potential new market. According to media reports in August of this year the Beachwood course was used as collateral for a R45 million rescue package raised by a group of club members in 2012. These members formed the DCC Trust. The club still owes the trust in the region of R37 million.Richard Pemberton chairman of the Durban Country Club had said that two hotel groups were interested in developing the area into a boutique hotel.
