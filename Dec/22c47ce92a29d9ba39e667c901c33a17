Nonkululeko Mjele was driving along Jan Smuts Avenue not far from the Joburg Zoo when a taxi in front of her suddenly stopped without notice at about 2.30pm. I hooted at him and he then started swearing at me in isiZulu. I then asked him how he can just stop without indicating. I then passed his taxi and drove off while he was left taking or delivering passengers Mjele said.As she drove off she thought the drama had ended but worse was to come. When I arrived at the traffic intersection he drove fast and came to block my path. He then went again and swore at me. He warned me that he is going to show me something. I asked him what that would be and he got even more furious Mjele said.The taxi driver got more agitated and walked out of his taxi and straight to her car. He first knocked on the window threatening me. He hit my mirror and it broke. That is when I took my phone and took a picture of his vehicle registration. He got more violent and hit my windscreen with his hand so hard that it broke and pieces of the glass fell on me and he left. I still do not understand what did I do to him that he would be so violent Mjele said.Mjele opened a case in Hillbrow police station and the matter is being investigated. TMG Digital
