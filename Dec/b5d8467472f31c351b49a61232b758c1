It was reported that medics chased the man down saying that he carried nothing but a large erection .EyeWitness News said the man had been taken into custody quoting Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson Wayne Minnaar as saying that the naked man who was reportedly running naked on the freeway wanting to commit suicide has been captured .Minnaar also told EWN that he would be taken to hospital for mental evaluation.Neolien @WordArtz was one of those who spotted the streaker and took to Twitter: @PigSpotter Naked man running along N1 S highway before Rivonia road and car on embankment. Not sure if related #doubletake .Some Twitter users got witty about the sighting like The Fatal Moves Team @FatalMoves which tweeted: NEWS FLASH? MT&gt; @EWNTraffic: #JHBTraffic There is a naked man running on the N1 South just before Rivonia Road .Papantsongo @TinyikoSAYS wanted more details and asked: Is he hung RT @EWNTraffic: #JHBTraffic There is a naked man running on the N1 South just before Rivonia Road .It wasn t the first time the JMPD had to deal with reports of a naked man causing traffic in morning traffic.In January officers were dispatched after reports of sightings of the nude man walking through slow-moving traffic on the busy M1. At the time Minnaar said he believed it could be a mentally disturbed homeless man that the JMPD had encountered previously. However Minnaar said the man always managed to avoid being apprehended by officers.That naked man piqued curiosity in some and freaked out those in a rush to get to work. It wasn t clear if Phumla Mazibu @stilbutterfly was offended or concerned for the man s safety when she tweeted: @CityofJoburgZA there is a naked man on the #M1 north before Carr str off ramp. Please inform police .Some seemed bummed about being held up on their early-morning commutes and questioned his sanity but Agent Provocateur @De_Imperial was despite getting the highway s direction wrong - only full of praise: Stark naked man on the M1 South. Birthday suit in the rain. Legend.
