Acton spoke to TMG Digital moments after Judge Dennis Davis told the court that judgment had been reserved on Acton s application to have the prohibition on cannabis declared unconstitutional. The aspect of [the private use of cannabis] is incontrovertibly going to be granted said Acton. They are going to throw it out in such a way that the Drugs and Trafficking Act is going to have nothing to do with cannabis. But how wide they go in terms of allowing us our economic abilities to use it might not happen in this court. It might come down to Dagga Party activism going into the next election. Earlier a full panel of judges grilled state advocate Thomas Bokaba asking him to justify the criminalising of dagga and to produce concrete opposition to the scientific evidence put before the court by Acton and activist Garreth Prince.Rastafarian lawyer Prince and the Dagga Party brought the issue before the High Court arguing that cannabis should not be a prohibited substance listed in the Drugs and Trafficking Act.They provided the court with reports and articles by commissions of inquiry on the benefits of cannabis but the state described their evidence as weak.Bokaba told the court there were no benefits to the use of dagga but Davis told him the state had to show why its approach was justified when there was evidence to suggest that there were better ways to deal with the issue than a complete ban.Acton said that lifting the ban would allow access to the economic opportunities of the plant.-TMG Digital/Sunday Times
