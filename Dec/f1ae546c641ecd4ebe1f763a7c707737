A CAS statement said world governing body FIFA's decision handed down in April had been set aside and replaced by its own verdict."Real Madrid CF is banned from registering any new players, either nationally or internationally, for one entire transfer period (previously two)," CAS said.The decision highlights the injustice of the original ban imposed by FIFA, although the club regrets that the CAS lacked the courage to revoke the ruling entirely, according to a CSA statement posted on the club's website. Real's initial $350,000 fine has been reduced to 240,000.
