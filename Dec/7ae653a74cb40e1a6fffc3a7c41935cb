Makhura on Thursday warned about the dangers of wanting to remain in government at all costs. If we are preoccupied with remaining in government we can wrong things. He said if the ANC-run provincial government continued to do good work it would not matter if the party was re-elected. Whether we get elected in 2019 at least we can say we did a good job. I don't mind sitting in the opposition benches. We would have left something for the people of Gauteng. The ANC lost two of Gauteng's metros - Johannesburg and Tshwane - to the Democratic Alliance (DA) in this year's local government elections.It was a bruising election for the governing party which saw its electoral support drop by eight percentage points. It also lost Nelson Mandela Bay metro in the Eastern Cape to the DA.The DA now has its sights set on Gauteng and is hoping to bring the ANC below 50% in 2019.The drop in the ANC's support has been attributed to the scandals surrounding President Jacob Zuma but shortly after the elections the party's leadership decided to take collective responsibility for the decline.Shortly before the elections the ANC in Gauteng had called on Zuma to do the right thing and step down.Similar calls by Gauteng have been made following the elections from some ANC veterans alliance partners and national executive committee members.Makhura admitted losing Johannebsurg and Tshwane was painful for the ANC and that it had to move beyond that.But Makhura said he also could not defend things that were wrong. I believe in the politics of honour he said. We can't defend ourselves on things that we are not doing right. Makhura said the ANC in Gauteng would fight tooth and nail to retain the province in 2019 but the party could not try stay in power at all costs. TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
