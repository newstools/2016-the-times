Maguvhe his legal team and the SABC executives including acting CEO James Aguma and Hlaudi Motsoeneng staged a mass walkout from the parliamentary committee on Wednesday morning.Before he testified on Tuesday afternoon the chairman of the ad hoc committee Vincent Smith informed the committee that Maguvhe was scheduled to appear on the 13th of December but requested to be accommodated on an earlier date as he would not be available. You did not appear [on the 8th of December]. You had to be summonsed to be here Smith said.Maguvhe however said he was originally scheduled to appear on the 7th of December. Then it was moved to the 14th and that is when I indicated that from the 9th I am not available. On the issue of walking out it was because my legal team requested an opportunity to address the committee in relation to my concerns. These concerns according to Maguvhe included: that he would need legal representation be given documents and be able to cross examine witnesses. My legal team could not raise those issues then I had to go out and consult them and ask what do I do. Maguvhe told the committee that parliament did not accommodate visually-impaired people like himself.The ad hoc committee is currently holding an inquiry into the fitness of the SABC board.
