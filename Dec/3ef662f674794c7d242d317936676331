Pirates have seen their title hopes take a knock after four matches without a win.The Bucs are seven points behind leaders Cape Town City albeit having played two fewer matches with catch-up games to come against BidVest Wits and Mamelodi Sundowns.Celtic saw their mini-recovery stalled on Saturday with a comprehensive 3-0 home loss to Ajax Cape Town.But Phunya Sele Sele co-coach Lehlohonolo Seema can take heart from recent performances against Pirates.They have just two defeats in their last nine meetings with The Buccaneers home and away and no team in the Premier Soccer League can boast a better record against the Soweto giants.Added to that if Pirates fail to claim the three points it will extend to five their winless run the longest they have gone in domestic football since seven matches without victory in 2009 under Ruud Krol.Current caretaker boss Augusto Palacios says the match will be difficult as he seeks answers to his side s predicament.But Palacios firmly believes a title challenge this year is still possible."We don t believe the chance to go to the top is lost there s still lot of points to play (for) he told reporters. The league is still a long way out and we still need to play the second round but we cannot continue dropping points. When we play Celtic we need to make sure that we take the points to win comfortable. Seema a former stalwart defender for both clubs wants to finish 2016 on a high to make their Christmas dinner taste sweeter and also foster some confidence going into the second half of the season. The freedom of movement and the telepathy among our players will be disrupted by the recess but again we must finish high he said."Our approach won t be different from our previous games."Every game that we play there is improvement from our team and everyone is fighting for their position. "We just have to raise the bar and pressurise our opponents. Celtic are only out of the relegation play-off position on goal-difference and could conceivably be bottom by the end of the final round of matches for the year. - TMG Digital
