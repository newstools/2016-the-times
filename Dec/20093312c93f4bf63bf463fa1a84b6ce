The 2012 Olympic champion - who defended his IBF title successfully on Saturday against American journeyman Eric Molina - will face Klitschko on April 29 at Wembley Stadium.He said the bout could be a life-changing experience for him."A knockout is the cherry on top, but to win, whichever way, is very possible," said Joshua, 27, at Wembley yesterday."This is a fight that can change one from champion to legend overnight. They are the type of fights that can change the way people view you."Klitschko, who will be 41 by April, said he had stayed in the sport since losing his WBA, IBF and WBO belts to Tyson Fury last year to regain his titles."I am obsessed with my goal to become the champion again," said Klitschko, who has not fought since that defeat.Joshua, who is 18-0 in his professional career and has never been taken the distance, conceded that while Klitschko might be on the elderly side for a boxer contesting a world title, it did not make him any less dangerous."I know what they mean when the say the old lion still roars and I know what that obsession is like because I live with that same obsession, it's just a clash of the titans," said Joshua, who was Klitschko's sparring partner early in his career.
