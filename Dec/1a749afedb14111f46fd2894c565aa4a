The 75-year-old, whose lyrics have influenced generations of fans, has had a subdued response to the honour, remaining silent for weeks following the news in October that he had won the prize for literature."This year's Laureate in Literature Bob Dylan will not be participating in the Nobel Week but he has provided a speech which will be read at the banquet," the foundation said.Rock legend Patti Smith will perform a version of Dylan's A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall at the ceremony on December 10 in Stockholm.Dylan said in a letter on November 16 that he would not attend the ceremony because he had "pre-existing commitments", in an announcement that did not come as a surprise to observers.Several other prizewinners have skipped the Nobel ceremony in the past for various reasons - Doris Lessing, who was too old; Harold Pinter, because he was hospitalised; and Elfriede Jelinek, who has social phobia.Dylan did not say a word about his prize on the day it was announced - October 13 - when he was performing in Las Vegas. The writer of Blowin' In The Wind, Like A Rolling Stone and Mr Tambourine Man confined himself to his songs.The Swedish Academy said it respected Dylan's decision, but that it was "unusual" for a Nobel laureate not to come to Stockholm to accept the award in person.
