Our plan goes through until the holidays are over [and] we will be out to deal decisively with motorists who don't abide by road rules " said TRMC spokesman Simon Zwane. Transport Minister Dipou Peters urged road users on Friday to be drive cautiously and to take other people's lives into consideration.

I therefore urge all road users motorists and pedestrians alike to make road safety their number one priority " Peters said in a statement on Friday. The minister also echoed Zwane's comments and warned motorists to obey the rules of the road.

This Tuesday she delivered a progress report on the campaign saying a total of 845 fatalities had been recorded on South African roads between December 1 and December 19. This festive season alone road fatalities have increased by 17% compared to the same period in the previous year. The provinces that recorded an increase in crashes include KwaZulu-Natal with an increase of 32 while Limpopo increased by 28 and the North West by nine. Peters encouraged motorists to be responsible on the roads. "These are really trying times. We need everyone to accept that roads are shared spaces and that road safety is everyone's responsibility " she said. Annually road fatalities cost the country an estimated R149 billion. - TMG Digital
