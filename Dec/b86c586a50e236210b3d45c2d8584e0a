Cabinet announced in October that it had decided to withdraw from the Rome Statute. It said the ICC was making it harder for South Africa to pursue peace and security in Africa because it strips leaders of their diplomatic immunity.The Democratic Alliance challenged the government s decision and the application began in the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday.The DA and other organisations want the court to declare the withdrawal unlawful.They also want the court to order President Jacob Zuma and the ministers of justice and international relations and cooperation to revoke the notice of withdrawal without delay.The withdrawal from the ICC follows the visit of Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir last year. He visited the country to cover the African Union Summit despite there being a warrant for his arrest issued by the ICC which is seeking to try him for alleged war crimes.South Africa as a signatory of the Rome Statute and having enacted local law adopting the statute was bound to execute the warrant of arrest.The Southern Africa Litigation Centre (SALC) sought the execution of the ICC warrant.Despite a court order instructing the state to ensure it prevented Al-Bashir from leaving the country the Sudanese president left South Africa after the summit.The Democratic Alliance argued that that the decision to withdraw from the ICC was a violation of the Constitution which grants the exclusive power to bind South Africa to international agreements to Parliament. This case is no different from a case where the executive breaches an ordinary statute but pleads that it intends to approach Parliament to have the statute amended. The mere fact that Parliament is seized with the repeal Bill is irrelevant counsel for Casac Anton Katz SC said.Katz said the appropriate way for the executive to deal with the matter was to table the repeal of the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the ICC Act the local law which enjoins South Africa to arrest people wanted by the ICC and to surrender such persons to the ICC. The executive has no power to act at all until Parliament has made a resolution Katz said.He said the fact that Parliament was seized with the matter of repealing the Implementation Act was irrelevant to the inquiry about the lawfulness of the conduct of the executive when it sent a note of withdrawal to the United Nations in October.SALC counsel Max du Plessis said the reasons given by the executive for its withdrawal from the ICC were not rational.Du Plessis said government s concern about the ICC was effectively about the welfare of one man Al-Bashir. He is the only head of state currently wanted by the ICC."The matter continues.
