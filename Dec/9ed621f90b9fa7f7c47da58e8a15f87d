The appointment follows the resignation of Brian Molefe earlier this month following the release of former public protector Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture report.The DA s Natasha Mazzone noted that her report states that the board was improperly appointed and it was therefore cause for concern that the board is simply recycling current members and introducing no new blood into the structure . At a time when (Public Enterprises Minister Lynne) Brown should be introducing fresh untainted and independent leadership to the highly controversial entity she is simply reinforcing concerns of personal interests within the board she said. The only chance Eskom has of proving its political independence to the South African people and proving that it is not a captured entity is a complete change in leadership by a politically neutral independent board made up of specialists in the field and not deployed cadres. Brown approved Koko s appointment on Wednesday saying he has a wealth of experience and understands the challenges Eskom faces. His appointment will also ensure continuity at Eskom . I have also asked the board to immediately start the process to appoint a permanent group CEO and that this process needs their urgent attention. Koko must ensure that the current trajectory at Eskom continues the minister added. TMG Digital
