State of CaptureFormer Public Protector Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture report was a talking point as it implicated among others president Jacob Zuma Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe Cooporative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen the Gupta family and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane.The report found that Zuma may have breached his executive code of ethics and may be conflicted over his son Duduzane's relationship with the Gupta family.According to the report Eskom was a source of lucrative contracts for the Gupta family and Duduzane Zuma through a company called Tegeta. The report published a diagram showing a distinct line of communication between Molefe the Gupta family and directors of their companies in the form of Ms (Ronica) Ragavan and Mr Howa. These links cannot be ignored as Mr Molefe did not declare his relationship with the Gupta family .Molefe resigned after defending his relationship with the Guptas and his frequent visits to the Gupta compound in Saxonwold. He got the country talking when he broke down as he explained his movements in the area sparking the Saxonwold Shebeen internet and social media meme.wahPravin fraud charge u-turnThe National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams (below) made headlines when he announced that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan former SARS commissioner Oupa Magashule and deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay would be prosecuted for fraud.

Olympic highs and rugby lowsOn a lighter more positive note the country had plenty to be proud about.Athletes Caster Semenya and Wayde van Niekerk flew the South African map high when they both scooped gold medals at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.Van Niekerk broke a 17 year-old record to win the 400 metre final while Semenya won the 800m.
