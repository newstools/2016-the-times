City are riding high on top of the league and also celebrating their cup success in the Telkom Knockout this past weekend while Stars are in the midst of a four-game losing streak that sees them hover just above the relegation zone.City coach Eric Tinkler it seems can do not wrong while his opposite number in this clash Cavin Johnson is struggling to get anything right.Johnson has received fulsome backing from his club in recent weeks but he has been around long enough to know that this is a result business and if things do not improve by the festive season break change might be coming.It has forced a rallying cry from Stars forward Benson Shilongo who netted twice in the side s 3-2 home loss to Polokwane City last time out. We need to stamp our authority. We need to man up he said. We have the quality and the finesse but probably we just lack the confidence."We will get there."We just have to keep on pushing."We have a bunch of talented lads so we just need to get together and start winning games. We need to regroup and keep our heads high."It s only us who can change things."There s nobody who can help us."We have to keep soldering on until we get the right combinations. City have won nine of their 10 games in all competitions and are bursting with confidence but this might just be the right time for Stars to be playing them.Tinkler has already bemoaned his side's travel schedule that saw them return probably with very sore heads from Polokwane on Sunday leaving them one day to prepare for the arrival of Stars.They will no doubt be on an emotional high but when reality bites and it is back to business in front of 1000 fans at the slightly soulless Athlone Stadium it could be a challenge to raise their level to their usual excellent standard.Stars have generally enjoyed a wretched time of it in Cape Town against the various Premier Soccer League clubs from the city but did find some rare success when they defeated Ajax 2-0 away from home almost three years ago to the day.Goal-scorers that day Solomon Mathe and Robert Ng ambi remain with the side and will carry the burden again in a team packed with promising young talent that is struggling to mature quickly enough for the top-flight. - TMG Digital
