A couple of months ago Bonang lusted over a Gucci bag. And her bae was paying attention.A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Dec 28, 2016 at 10:22am PSTThe Dionysus GG Supreme is priced as $3,800 on Gucci's official site. With the current exchange rate that means that AKA paid over R52,000.Yoh! But B, how do you even beat that?Also, if he's spending R50k on a bag, imagine the ring... when it comes!
