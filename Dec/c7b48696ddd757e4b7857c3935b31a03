Four people died in the Western Cape.The North West and Northern Cape each recorded one death. The Northern Cape also registered four amputations.Expressing its regret at the loss of life the Department of Traditional Affairs said on Wednesday that "all stakeholders are working tirelessly with all role-players to curb this challenge"."We had hoped that no death would be recorded but unfortunately we still continue to experience challenges especially with regard to bogus initiation schools where most of injuries and deaths occur."The department said government officials had met with non-government organisations Amakhosi and communities to improve the safety of initiates and to combat abuse and assaults of initiates.Teams would continue to monitor the situation across the country throughout the current initiation season. "We are urging communities especially parents care givers or legal guardians to play their part."The department said interventions were being made to rescue those in distress saying that on 12 December 2016 22 female initiates were rescued from illegal initiation schools at De Deur and Evaton in Sedibeng.The Department of Traditional Affairs has drafted a policy on the customary practice of initiation which aims to provide acceptable norms and standards protect initiates from death injury and to ensure roleplayers accept responsibility ensure effective co-ordination and monitoring."Provincial government continues to strengthen their measures to curb further fatalities."These measures will be complemented by the legislation that will soon be approved by Cabinet to ensure tough measures are taken to deal with those who are using this important practice for their own selfish benefit " the department said.It praised the practice of initiation adding government would continue to support the rite "in a secure environment"."This rite of passage marks the entrance or acceptance into a group or society. It could also be a formal admission to adulthood in a community or one of its formal components. In an extended sense it can also signify a transformation in which the initiate is 'reborn' into playing a new role in society having being educated mentored and trained to become a responsible adult."...Initiation schools are still and continue to be important for our communities restoring dignity and pride to the African people."
