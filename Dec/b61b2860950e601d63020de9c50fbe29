But the EFF commander in chief made our hearts a little soft when he opened up about his wife Mantwa during an interview with Anele on Real Talk."I used to drink and go to clubs. I started going to movies now because my wife forced me."He said that as much as he doesn't enjoy going to movies, worried that people might recognise him, he is grateful for his mrs."She completes me. She's able to speak a lot of sense and persuade me to see certain things different and get me to do things I haven't done. And watching Perfect Wedding (Our Perfect Wedding). Things I used to think were girly things... I enjoy them."He also opened up about the moment he proposed, explaining that he was nervous and when he got on his knee to propose, Mantwa got up."I had to pretend to tie my shoe," he said.See, we all have a soft side.
