Police arrived on the scene to find the would-be robber dead and hanging from a residential palisade fence after apparently attempting to flee the scene. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed the incident. A man was found hanging from palisade fencing at approximately 4:30 am on Sunday morning. Next to him were a TV set and two jackets which we suspect were stolen during a robbery two houses away from the scene reported earlier in the morning. The deceased was approximately 25-years-old. Captain Masondo said that an inquest had been opened. We are investigating whether the man was alone at the time of his death. - TMG Digital
