 On Thursday the 29th of December the monthly new moon occurs. This means that the twice monthly Spring Tide (which occurs at full moon and at new moon) peaks on Thursday. Spring tides happen twice every month at full moon and at new moon and bring higher than normal high tides lower than normal low tides and stronger than normal rip currents around the coastline. There are two high tides and two low tides every day the NSRI cautioned.It said Spring tide would start to build in intensity from Monday peaking on Thursday the day of the new moon and gradually lessening in intensity towards about next Monday. Anyone visiting the beach from today 26th December will notice that these twice daily high tides start to gradually get higher than normal as this week progresses and the twice daily low tides gradually start to get lower than normal as this week progresses peaking on the day of the New Moon on Thursday 29th December. It will also become visibly noticeable that rip-currents will begin to get stronger than normal from today onwards. NSRI are urging bathers paddlers and anglers to be aware of this years end of the year New Moon Spring Tide happening at a time when most families will be visiting the beach (coastline) and extreme caution around the coast is advised the sea rescue organisation said.
