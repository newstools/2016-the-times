For one of the most sought after players in the game who commands a fortune for his services that approach could be key to extending his time in a South Africa shirt.Steyn who broke the same shoulder for the second time in a year during South Africa s tour to Australia early in November is in recovery from an operation a month ago in which the joint was repaired and strengthened by the insertion of a pin.At the time of the surgery South African team manager Mohammed Moosajee who is also the side s doctor said Steyn should expect a minimum six-month rehabilitation period before he can start any form of bowling .But the fast bowler was hopeful of a less bleak prognosis. They say the first two to three months is just the healing phase but by the end of February I ll be able to do things like light bowling and start swimming Steyn said.Currently his options for physical activity were limited. I m supposed to be doing spinning but I find it so boring he said. But in less than two weeks I can start running. Not that Steyn was complaining too much. It s actually really cool he said. I haven t had a long break like this in a good few years. Every season I go in with something wrong. And we hide them well. We re all cricketers everyone s playing with something. It will be nice to go into a season starting in June or whatever confidently knowing that I m actually strong and in a good place. June?So along with the series in all three formats against Sri Lanka Steyn will miss the test one-day and T20 tour to New Zealand as well as the one-day rubber in England.But he might be back for the Champions Trophy in England - South Africa s first match is on June 3 - and their test and T20 rubbers there.If Steyn is out until June he will miss the IPL which will run from April 3 to May 26 and comprise 72 matches. I don t think I ll get to any of that stuff - that s realistic Steyn said. It s all for South Africa. All together now: Amen. - TMG Digital
