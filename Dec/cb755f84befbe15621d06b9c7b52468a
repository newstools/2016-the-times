The visitors reached lunch on 37/3 in reply to South Africa s first innings of 286.Seven wickets fell for the addition of 56 runs in the 21.5 overs bowled in the morning session a pattern of play perhaps fuelled by intense humidity and the easterly breeze bringing moisture from the sea.South Africa resumed on 267/6 and added just 14 runs before they were dismissed 53 balls into the day s play with seamer Suranga Lakmal completing a haul of 5/63 his maiden five-wicket effort in his 32nd test.The slide started in the day s fifth over when Nuwan Pradeep had Vernon Philander caught at deep square leg.South Africa s hopes of posting a more respectable total were snuffed out when Pradeep yorked Quinton de Kock for 37 to end the innings.But Sri Lanka s satisfaction with their bowling performance was quelled when their batsmen slumped to 22/3 after eight overs.Dimuth Karunaratne drove expansively at Kyle Abbott and dragged the ball onto his leg stump before Kusal Perera and Kusal Mendis were caught behind - both after playing rash strokes - off Philander and Abbott.Opener Kaushal Silva showed more discipline and was still there at lunch on 12 with captain Angelo Mathews five not out.Abbott took 2/13 from six overs and Philander 1/9 from five.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
