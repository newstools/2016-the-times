CAPE Town City will be without experienced striker Lehlohonolo Majoro for the Telkom Knockout final against SuperSport United on Saturday, a blow that coach Eric Tinkler says the club will have to overcome.The majority of the City side will be featuring in their first cup final, where Majoro's experience after spells at Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates would have been welcome.Instead he will have to offer support from the sidelines, along with Latvian defender Renars Rode, who has a hamstring tweak. Tinkler says the quality of Majoro, especially, will be missed after the forward ended a barren run in front of goal with three goals in six matches before being injured in the 1-1 draw with Chiefs last week."He's injured and won't be available for the final," Tinkler confirms. "I always knew he had that ability to come back and if he worked extremely hard. He has the natural ability to score goals." The former Pirates coach, who lost two finals with the Buccaneers during his tenure there, says he is feeling no pressure ahead of Saturday's clash."SuperSport go into the game as favourites. They are a team that Stuart Baxter has built to win the league. They have that potential. "Game by game they have got better and better," Tinkler says."The demands at the club are obviously to win things this season, so it's going to be a tough game. But we go in there with no pressure because nobody expected us to be where we are."The reality is we are here because of the quality of the football we can produce. Going forward we will always create opportunities and score goals," Tinkler says. - TMG Digital
