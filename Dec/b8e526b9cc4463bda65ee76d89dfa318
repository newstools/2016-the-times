It was announced last Thursday by Big Concerts in association with Discovery, that the Canadian-born global sensation is headed to Mzansi in May next year as part of his 'Purpose World Tour.'Tickets for the highly-anticipated Johannesburg and Cape Town shows go on sale this Thursday, 15 December and range from R350 to R1,540.However, according to updated ticket price information, fans looking for a 'more intimate' experience can expect to fork out thousands of rands for a VIP experience.These hospitality packages have been derived by Justin Bieber's management team, and are a standard offering during all of his tours across the world.'The Ultimate Purpose Backstage VIP Experience' priced at R15,000 will give a fan one ticket to the 'J' or 'B' pit inside the stage, a pre-show backstage tour of what happens behind-the-scenes, access to the Purpose VIP lounge, a merchandise package, a commemorative laminate and access to a concierge.'The I'll Show You Backstage VIP Pit Experience' for R8,050 excludes the pre-show backstage tour. While, the 'Where Are U Now VIP Experience' for R4,500 will get a fan one reserved ticket, a merchandise package and one commemorative laminate.While concert hospitality packages usually include a fan meet and greet or photo opportunity, this does not apply to Justin Bieber.In March this year Bieber left fans across the globe heartbroken, when he abruptly canned all fan meet and greets for the rest of his Purpose World Tour.Bieber made the surprise announcement on his Instagram account at the time."Love u guys.. I m going to be canceling my meet and greets. I enjoy meeting such incredible people but I end up feeling so drained and filled with so much of other people s spiritual energy that I end up so drained and unhappy," he said.Bieber added that the meet and greets always left him feeling "emotionally exhausted".Over the past year alone there have been a host of US A-listers including the likes of Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey who have visited Mzansi's shores.During Nicki Minaj's Pink Print Tour to the country in March this year, fans paid almost R3,000 for a meet and greet. However, excited fans were left disappointed when Nicki told them after the show that she had not agreed to do any meet and greets.Despite the circumstances Nicki agreed to take group pictures with fans who had waited hours for her.When Mariah Carey headed to SA in May this year, die-hard fans forked out R7,190 for a VIP and Hospitality package, which included a meet and greet, as well as, a professional photo opportunity.
