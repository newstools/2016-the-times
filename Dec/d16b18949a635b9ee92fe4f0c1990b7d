For some this may mean failing a subject or not achieving the high goals they had set for themselves which could be the difference between getting into the university course of their choice."We live in a world where performance is rewarded and judgments are made based on what we do and how well we do it " says psychologist Lee-Ann Hartman quoted on the South African Anxiety and Depression Group's (SADAG) website.Whatever the source of disappointment it is important for parents to help their children understand that they will bounce back experts advise.The Independent Institute of Education's Nola Payne identifies practical steps to assist parents in the build-up to results day and what may follow. "Responsible adults are encouraged to ask direct questions such as when and where and how the young person will access their results. Build your plans around those of the young person " Payne says."Share your own feelings of anxiety and normalise it for instance by saying: 'I am feeling stressed about your results too but remember we can figure this out together and take it from there.' Reaffirm your unconditional acceptance of the young person."If the results are disappointing parents should begin talking about other options to illustrate that this is not the end of the world she says.Ideally parents should have explored other options like vocational training or rewriting the exams ahead of the conversation.Payne urges parents to manage their own emotions and focus on their children as negative first words and reactions may have a lasting impact.SADAG says that it is important to help young people understand that failure is a normal part of life."It's normal to feel down and angry and disappointed if you don't do as well as you wanted but it doesn't have to be the end of your world " it says.Instead of fixating on failure it should be accepted as an opportunity for further learning."Failure is often one of the greatest gifts we can get because we learn so much " says Hartman.SADAG encourages parents and young people to seek help. It runs a counselling helpline that is open seven days a week from 8am to 8pm.According to SADAG 9.5% of teen deaths in South Africa are caused by suicide."There are children who have undiagnosed depression or who undergo a trauma or an experience that makes them more vulnerable and this can be the final stress that causes them to commit suicide or use drugs " says SADAG's Dessy Tzoneva.- TMG Digtial
