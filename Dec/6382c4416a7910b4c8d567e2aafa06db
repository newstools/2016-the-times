Masuluke - up for a corner in the final seconds of added time on Wednesday night - received a looping half-clearance from the corner by Orlando Pirates' goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane just inside the area with his back to goal, and produced a 17-metre overhead kick that has taken social media by storm in South Africa and around the world.Absolutely unreal scenes as Baroka FC's goalkeeper scores 95th minute overhead-kick! pic.twitter.com/XXQ96AHVCv The 96th-minute winner was one of those rare and randomly unexplainable moments of brilliance and magic rarely seen on a football field. An occasion of inpiration that only the football gods, or perhaps a momentary anomaly in the alignment of the planets at that particular milisecond that Masuluke decided through pure instinct to do what he did, could possibly account for.It robbed Pirates of what would have been a somewhat fortunate third victory in succession under caretaker-coach Augusto Palacios.
