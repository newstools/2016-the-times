The decision had not been an easy one to make said Lesiba Seshoka the university s spokesperson.UKZN s Council approved an 8% tuition and an 8% residence accommodation fee increase for the 2017 academic year.But only students with a household income above R600 000 will pay the 8% increase. Up to 70% of our students will not be required to pay increased fees because the National Student Financial Aid Scheme and state funding through the Department of Higher Education and Training will kick in for students who qualify for NSFAS funding and those who have a household income below R600 000 a year the statement said.Seshoka said the increase was guided by Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande s capping of fee increases at 8% operational costs and the rand-dollar exchange rate.
