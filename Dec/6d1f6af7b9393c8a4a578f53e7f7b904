Caster had social media in a tizz earlier this week when she told her haters to 'tsek' on live TV. They say she talks like a man, she walks like a man, she runs like a man 'tsek, Caster said during an acceptance speech at the SA Sports Awards.Those are feisty words from an athlete, who has had to stand up to a barrage of criticism over the years.Speaking to Elle magazine recently, Caster said that her family accept and support her, but that her journey to self- acceptance came by learning that only God could judge."My family accept me, the person that I am. They love me the way I am. At the end of the day, it's about how you feel, and how you see yourself. Only God can create and judge, and only God can give and take, that's how I see life."I knew from a young age that's how it was. I cannot change it. I don't want to change it. I have to be who I am. We have to be who we are. Be yourself, be natural, she said.The athlete told the publication that she "didn't want to be a star" and was simply focusing on being herself."I just have to be me for me. They have to see the real me. If I am going to live for other people, I am not 'me'. I have a responsibility towards myself," Caster said.
