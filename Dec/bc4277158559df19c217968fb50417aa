Eight wild dogs - five females and three males - were darted in Tembe Elephant Park and UmPhafa Private Nature Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal for relocation to Botswana at 4am this morning.They are now en route to Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve.The move is part of a plan to boost the neighbouring country's wild dog population.David Marneweck, of the Endangered Wildlife Trust, said the males and a vet were collected from an airfield in Ladysmith and flown to Mkhuze airfield at 6am, when they met the females.This, however, is just the start of their 12-hour journey today.Marneweck said all eight wild dogs would be flown to the Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport for customs and clearance, before being flown to an airstrip in the Tuli block."They will be driven to a holding boma in the Northern Tuli Game Reserve, where they will be woken up," he said.Every precaution had been taken to ensure safe passage for South Africa's most endangered carnivore, he said.Attempts up until now to beef up South Africa's wild dogs population, with the use of private reserves have been successful.The hope now is that the eight wild dogs will become the catalyst for similar successes in Botswana."We want wild dogs taken off the [endangered species] list."We are looking for new reserves that provide a safe space for them."This is going to be the new population [in Northern Tuli]; the resident population," Marneweck said.The entire trip will be tweeted live by the Endangered Wildlife Trust on @TheEWT.
