The unveiling was part of the 350-year commemoration of the castle which played an integral part of the colonial government s exploits from the 17th century.In the presence of various royal representatives Mapisa-Nqakula unveiled the statues of amaHlubi king Langalibalele Zulu king Cetshwayo Bapedi king Sekhukhune and Khoisan freedom fighter Doman.The four were incarcerated at the castle when they fought against land dispossession.In attendance was Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi who saluted as the statue of the Zulu king was unveiled. Mapisa-Nqakula was standing in for President Jacob Zuma who was to have delivered the keynote address but pulled out at the last minute.Mapisa-Nqakula said the castle could be described as a symbol of the beginning of an era that sent South Africa on a destructive past of colonial injustices and racial oppression.But she said the South African government was commemorating its history because the democratic country s founding president Nelson Mandela said the castle and many other symbols of the past should be kept as a reminder and lesson to never return the country to a similar era. She said that when the castle was built it was intended to be a solid defence against two enemies Europeans who could attack from the sea and the indigenous people who sought the return of their land and freedom.As part of the build-up to the commemoration the castle received a R108-million facelift earlier this year. Historically the castle was a centre around which Cape Town and South Africa developed. Almost every South African alive today has in one way or another been affected by decisions made at this castle said Mapisa-Nqakula.She said that despite its history the castle had not received much prominence. The (castle) took a backseat as compared to Robben Island Freedom Park the Cradle of Humankind and many other heritage sites she said.Mapisa-Nqakula promised that government will apply for the Castle of Good Hope to be a World Heritage Site. We are also opening the first-ever centre for memory healing and learning (at the castle) in recognition of what took place here she said. TMG Digital
