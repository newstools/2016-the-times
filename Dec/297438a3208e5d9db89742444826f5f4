This is odd considering that the NPA [National Prosecuting Authority] is concerned with prosecutions not policing or the management of protests and/or riots said Breytenbach.The opposition party is planning to ask more questions in Parliament to further probe the Minister s reasoning on why Abrahams was at Luthuli House .Breytenbach asserted that Abrahams was not fit for office and had damaged the reputation of the NPA.
