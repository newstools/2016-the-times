This is according to municipal infrastructure engineering and electricity political head Annette Lovemore.The municipality has imposed punitive water restrictions since December 1 following an instruction by Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane.The use of borehole water to fill up swimming pools has become increasingly popular since the restrictions were put in place.But Lovemore said no one was allowed to profit from the sale or delivery of water within the metro s boundaries. Only the municipality has permission to sell water from municipal systems or natural resources she said. At a time like this we must have full control over our water resources. We cannot allow the abuse of our supplies for personal profits. We cannot allow personal good to trump the public good. This story appeared in The Herald - TMG Digital/The Herald
