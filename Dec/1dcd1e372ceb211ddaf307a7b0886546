Star gazers in Cape Town Springbok and Calvinia will likely have the best shot of wishing on those falling stars due to the weather but according to Weather SA's forecast the rest of the country will be cloudy and wet for the peak viewing times between 10pm to 2am on Wednesday.This will be the third supermoon in a row since October though it will not be as large as the one last month.What are the Geminids?The Geminids are one of the most reliable meteor showers visible in the night sky occurring around this time every year.This is because this is the time of year when Earth passes through the orbital path of asteroid 3200 Phaethon.The asteroid s orbit takes it very close to the sun every 1.43 years which makes it very hot and very liable to crack and break up.Thus it leaves a trail of rocks in Earth s path. These in turn burn up in our atmosphere as our planet passes through them giving a natural fireworks display in the night sky that looks like it originates around the constellation of Gemini hence the name.Here is how the meteor shower looked in 2014. How visible will they be?According to Nasa the display isn t going to be as spectacular in the Southern hemisphere due to the fact that the Geminid radiant won t be as high in our sky.The supermoon will be located near the constellation of Taurus which is quite close to Gemini and thus will hide the less bright meteors.Add in the weather and chances are for most of South Africa it won t be as spectacular a display as it could be though it should still be worth looking up.
