On arrival on the scene paramedics commenced CPR (Cardio Pulmonary resuscitation efforts) but after all CPR efforts were exhausted sadly the man was declared deceased by paramedics. The body of the man has been taken into the care of the Forensic Pathology Services and Police have opened an inquest docket Zimmerman added.
