It looked as though Chippa would hold on for a point with a battling defensive display, but Ajax created a host of chances and finally got their goal when Nxumalo was sent clear on goal and chipped the ball over the United keeper Daniel Akpeyi. The win moves the Urban Warriors into the top half of the table and is a fifth victory in six games as Dutch coach Stanley Menzo proves he has the right formula at the Ikamva club.Chippa looked happy with a point as they got men behind the ball, but created little in the Ajax attacking third and slip to 11th.Menzo left winger Mark Mayambela on the bench, but did start exciting 18-year-old talent Grant Margeman, who did not disappoint.It took almost 10 minutes for the first shot on goal and it was a well-hit effort from the edge of the box by Chippa s Lerato Manzini that had Ajax keeper Jody February at full stretch, but the save was comfortable in the end. Ndiviwe Mdabuka fired well over the top at the other end when he really should have hit the target, before Margeman set up him up for a chance in the box, but the former wanted too many touches and Chippa were able to get in a block.And it really should have been 1-0 to Ajax when Thabo Mosadi sent Prince Nxumalo one-on-one with Chippa keeper Akpeyi, but the forward saw his side-footed effort saved.Margeman then let fly from a full 40-yards and with the ball arrowing for the top corner, Akpeyi produced an excellent stop, before the 18-year-old let fly again in injury-time and saw his shot beaten away once more. The second half started much the same, with Ajax on the front foot.Mdabuka worked himself into space on the left and his low cross was turned goalwards by Nxumalo, but the effort blocked once more.Mosadi produced an excellent run and shot that was beaten away by Akpeyi, while Chippa had a rare chance when they won a free-kick on the edge of the Ajax box, but February comfortably saved from Manzini. The telling moment came in the 88th minute when Travis Graham, who had a poor night to that point, set Nxumalo clear and the forward provided a cool finish for his third goal of the season. Ajax restart their league campaign on February 7 away at BidVest Wits, while Chippa are in action a day later at home to Baroka FC. - TMG Digital
