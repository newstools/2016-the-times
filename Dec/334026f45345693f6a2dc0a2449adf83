Issuing the latest rankings this week after a busy round of internationals the World Rugby organisation said: "Ireland and Scotland both gained ground from a rankings perspective while South Africa were the biggest losers in the top 10 as the jockeying for positions ahead of next May s Rugby World Cup 2019 draw intensified over the November period".If the pools were drawn now New Zealand (currently ranked one) England (two) Australia (three) and Ireland (four) would be kept apart as they are ranked as the top four seeds among the 12 direct qualifiers from RWC 2015.With four pools of five teams each top seed is drawn with a side ranked fifth to eighth and then one from ninth to 12th. The remaining eight teams are drawn from two further bands.This means that as things stand it is possible that reigning world champions New Zealand who celebrated their seven-year anniversary as the world s top ranked team during November could be drawn alongside two of last year's Rugby World Cup semi-finalists - South Africa and Argentina.Here's how the top 10 teams shaped up over the November window from a rankings perspective.*Pre-November rankings in brackets1. New Zealand (1) Down 1.79 pointsThe All Blacks rallied well after their record 18-match winning run came to an end with defeat against Ireland (40-29) in Chicago beating Italy (68-10) Ireland (21-9) and France (24-19). Nevertheless over the course of the month their lead at the top of the rankings was cut from 7.08 points to 4.32.2. England (2) Up 0.97 pointsThere was no stopping Eddie Jones men as wins over South Africa (37-21) Fiji (58-15) Argentina (27-14) and Australia (37-21) took them past the 90-point mark in the rankings and equalled their best-ever run of 14 straight victories.3. Australia (3) Up 1.02 pointsThe Wallabies marginally improved their rating points despite losing two of their five internationals in Europe. After opening with an emphatic win over Wales (32-8) Michael Cheika s men repeated their one-point win over Scotland in the RWC 2015 quarter-final with a 23-22 victory and then edged France 25-23. But any hopes of a Grand Slam were dashed when they lost to Ireland (27-24) before a long season ended with a 37-21 defeat at Twickenham.4. Ireland (6) Up 2.95 pointsThe biggest mover in terms of points and positions gained. A first-ever victory over the All Blacks set the tone for a wonderful campaign which also yielded wins against Canada (52-21) and Australia (27-24) the latter result a fine way for captain Rory Best to mark his 100th cap for Ireland. The only blot on their copybook was the 21-9 loss to the All Blacks in Dublin.5. Wales (5) Up 0.06 pointsWales gained six hundredths of a point over the course of a campaign that produced three wins out of four but did little to silence the critics. Rob Howley s men responded to the heavy defeat to Australia with hard-fought wins over Argentina (24-20) and Japan (33-30) before seeing off South Africa for only the third time in their history 27-13.6. South Africa (4) Down 3.06 pointsA difficult campaign that saw South Africa suffer three straight losses after kicking off their tour with an entertaining 31-31 draw against the Barbarians at Twickenham. Defeats to England (37-21) and Wales (27-13) came either side of a first-ever loss to Italy (20-18) and resulted in the Springboks dropping to sixth to equal their lowest position since the rankings were introduced in October 2003.7. Scotland (8) Up 0.23 pointsThe Scots climbed up to seventh their highest position for five years after an encouraging November campaign that brought wins over Argentina (19-16) and Georgia (43-16) following the heartache of the near-miss against Australia.8. France (7) Down 0.62 pointsEven though Les Bleus lost a bit of ground in the rankings they will take heart from their performances in November. A clinical display of finishing saw them put 50 points on Samoa before the southern hemisphere s top two Australia (25-23) and New Zealand (24-19) were pushed to the limit.9. Argentina (9) Down 0.40 pointsThe travel-weary Los Pumas hung onto ninth spot in the rankings despite losing four-tenths of a point across the month. A crushing 54-20 win against a inexperienced Japan side was followed by tight defeats to Wales (24-20) and Scotland (19-16) before their tour came to an end with a 27-14 loss to England.10. Fiji (10th) Up 1.03 pointsThe reigning World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup champions made up for heavy defeats to the Barbarians (40-7) and England (58-15) to win the one that really mattered against Japan where defeat to the Brave Blossoms in the French town of Vannes would have cost them their place in the world s top 10. Two tries from Levani Botia helped them secure a 38-25 victory.And just for South African interest after the Boks lost to them here's what the world rugby organisation has to say about Japan:11. Japan (12) Up 0.73 pointsJamie Joseph s first run of matches in charge of the Brave Blossoms produced a mixed bag of results as the New Zealander tried out new combinations and blooded a lot of young players. Japan rallied well after the loss to Los Pumas to end Georgia s seven-match unbeaten run at home with a creditable 28-22 victory in Tbilisi. Only Sam Davies last-gasp drop goal prevented them drawing with Wales before they lost out to Fiji in their final fixture. - TMG Digital
