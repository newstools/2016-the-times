Hammond's visit to South Africa this week is part of a plan to strengthen ties with non-EU partners before Britain exits the EU.He has already held a string of "constructive" talks with top political and business leaders in the country."As Britain leaves the EU, we will be deepening our work with our international partners to build ever stronger economic links around the world," he said in a statement issued by the British embassy."South Africa is a key strategic partner for the UK in Africa and internationally and we are determined to see that go from strength to strength."Hammond, who on Tuesday was in Brussels to discuss Britain's impending departure from the EU, is "on a series of international trips to showcase the UK's commitment to forming even stronger global ties".Prime Minister Theresa May has stated she will formally trigger the two-year EU divorce process by the end of March .However, Brussels and London face the daunting prospect of gruelling negotiations on future trade deals with the EU and countries outside the bloc.In South Africa Hammond met his counterpart, Pravin Gordhan, and International Relations and Co-operation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane.He also visited the JSE and took part in a round table discussion with business leaders from major local companies.During the talks with political leaders, he confirmed "up to 35-million for an ambitious new prosperity programme over the next four years supporting inclusive economic development in South Africa".The two countries will achieve this by working together to "tackle barriers to trade and growth, increase competitiveness and improve ease of doing business"."This funding is a key part of the UK's strategy for helping promote economic growth."South Africa is Britain's biggest export market in Africa, with its bilateral trade hitting almost 8-billion.To build on the close business ties between the two countries, several commercial deals were announced, including a $180-million Rolls-Royce service contract with SA Airways."SAA has signed a new TotalCare service order for Trent 700 engines made by British company Rolls-Royce that power five Airbus A330 aircraft," the statement said.Today Hammond is expected in Cape Town, where he will meet start-ups to discuss synergies with British IT businesses and investors.From South Africa he flies to Japan to meet the Finance Minister Taro Aso and Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Softbank chief executive Masayoshi Son.He will also later visit South Korea.
