Five reasons why Cape Town City will win the Telkom TKO1) Lebohagang ManyamaThe industrious Alexandra born star has been one of the key players for Cape Town City this season having scored eight goals in all competitions.His work rate has been phenomenal and he provides that midfield aggression especially when City are in desperate need of goals.2) Aubrey NgomaThe 27 year-old has been in excellent form in helping the Western Cape outfit to win six games in a row in all competitions.Ngoma has done well since coach Eric Tinkler allowed him to roam free on the left wing exposing slow defenders with his breathtaking pace.3) Matthew "Matt" SimThe 28-year-old Australian will hope to claim his first title as a professional footballer on Saturday at Peter Mokaba Stadium.He knew that he would be a marked man after his goal scoring feats at the beginning of the season and yet the midfielder has still found ways to get the better of opposition defences this season.4) Thamsanqa MkhizeThe 28-year-old defender has fitted superbly into the right-back position and has became coach Eric Tinkler's number one choice ahead of Vincent Kobola.5) Shu-Aib WaltersThe veteran goalkeeper's decade-long experience marshalling the rearguard will be key for the Cape side.The 34-year-old has never won a trophy in his PSL career and will hope to change that when his side collide with SuperSport United in the TKO final. - TMG Digital
