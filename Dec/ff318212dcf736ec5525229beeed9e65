It is good that we are celebrating each other as black people," he told the local publication.But sadly Mdu is taken. Sad face. And he credited his wife with helping him look good."I maintain a positive lifestyle. I take care of myself both spiritually and physically. I also have a good wife who takes care of me and is not bothered by the attention I get from other woman," he said.Not only did Mdu resurface into the spotlight as 'Uncle Bae,' but he also revealed that he was on a mission to revive kwaito music and to prove to its detractors that it is far from dead.Mdu was a pioneer of kwaito music during the 1990s, along with Mandoza, Boom Shaka, Trompies, Brown Dash and Spikiri, to name a few.
