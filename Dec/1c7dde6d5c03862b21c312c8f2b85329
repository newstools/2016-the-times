Luis saw me and recommended me to come here and now I find myself here in Cape Town at Ajax said Kabwe said. It has been really fantastic the guys are friendly and I am feeling good. I have only been here for little over a week so it is quite interesting and I hope we will build on our relationships when I come back [in the New Year]. This will be my first international club. I am really excited and I thank God for it. I wouldn t say much about myself right now come and watch for yourself next year. Ajax s first game of the New Year will be away at Bidvest Wits on February 7. TMG Sport
