So says the SA National Roads Agency, which announced last week that roadworks on major routes would be halted to reduce traffic delays over the festive period.While holidaymakers have already started making their way to the coast, the highest traffic volumes are expected on Thursday, ahead of the long weekend.Sanral spokesman Vusi Mona said road construction work had been halted on 21946km of freeways to improve safety."Road conditions are good and holidaymakers can expect trouble-free journeys throughout the route, barring unforeseen traffic incidents or adverse weather conditions," said Mona.Day of Reconciliation, Christmas Day and New Year's Day will be celebrated on, or close to, weekends, which will result in "higher [traffic] volumes in the preceding days as people travel to destinations in time for celebrations".Mona said motorists needed to be mindful that the roads were a "shared environment" and that obeying the rules of the road was vital to ensure a fatality-free festive season.The World Health Organisation's global status report on road safety shows South Africa and India rate 2.6 out of 10 in quality of traffic law enforcement. The report found that there was a strong correlation between the quality of law enforcement and fatality rates.Transport Minister Dipuo Peters touched on the subject at a national traffic indaba last week. She said the answer to reducing road deaths was an integrated, national traffic enforcement service.Between December 1 2015 and January 11 this year 1235 fatal crashes were recorded on South Africa's roads, an 11% increase compared with the same period the year before.Peters said South Africa's high accident rate adversely affected the economy.A study by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the Road Traffic Management Corporation showed that the total cost of road crashes for last year was an estimated R143-billion.
