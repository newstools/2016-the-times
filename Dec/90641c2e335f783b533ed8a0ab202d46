The advocate won his case to have a doctor help him die and ensure the doctor would face no sanction but was already dead.The lawyers and judge were unaware that about two hours before the order was handed down he had passed away.In a court ruling on Tuesday all five Supreme Court Judges upheld the state and Health Professionals Council of SA's appeal against the high court decision allowing Stransham-Ford to die. This was thought to have set a precedent that would allow other terminally-ill people to approach the court for help.Cancer patient Stransham-Ford had argued that his pain and his inability to look after himself affronted his constitutional right to dignity and bodily integrity.The Health Professions Council of SA that regulates doctors had appealed the ruling arguing it should have been overturned because it was made after he died.They had asked Judge Hans Fabricius to overturn the ruling within days of him making it and were dismissed.The council argued at the Supreme Court that his death may have been kept from lawyers and judges so the order could continue. He died at 8.07am. However his doctor was called about this hours later after the ruling. One of the first things his ex-wife Penelope Stransham-Ford said to the treating doctor was that Starnsham-Ford had won his case according to court papers.The judges found that "we do not know why Judge Hans Fabricius was not informed of Mr Stransham-Ford s death before he handed down his order".But it noted with disquiet the fact that his treating doctor was informed after the death and ruling. "It is difficult to avoid the inference that his death was not reported because it was thought that it might affect the decision."The judges also found that the order was specific to his wish to die with help and on a day of his choosing. They say that he died before the ruling meaning it didn t apply and for this reason had to be overturned."The nature of the relief claimed by Stransham-Ford males it clear that this was a personal action. .His death extinguished his claim for relief."Many NGOs for and against the right for doctor-assisted suicide were involved in the court case - arguing that the right to choose when to die and have a doctor's assistance was a constitutional issue raising rights of dignity and autonomy .But the court said it could not decide on Constitutional issues relating to his case because the case itself was not valid."The court must wait for litigants to bring an appropriate case before them that warrant such development."However in another strange twist lawyers confirm that the order to allow him to die was seen by all parties the night before he died but it was not signed because the case was postponed for one day.Stransham-Ford was friends with IFP member of parliament Mario Oriani-Ambroisini who shot himself to end his battle with stage 4 lung cancer while his seven-year old son was in the house.
