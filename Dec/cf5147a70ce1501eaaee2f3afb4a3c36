Rosko Specman Blitzboks vs NZ Cape Town Stadium December 12 From a lineout inside their own 22-metre area Werner Kok switched play. He found Specman with a lovely pass and the speedster jinked his way through two tackles for a memorable score from 80m. 4. Ruan Combrinck Lions vs Crusaders Ellis Park July 23 Lionel Mapoe ran a great angle to split the Crusaders defence from deep inside his own half. Combrinck blazed in support and received a deft inside ball from 40-metres out. There was still a lot of work to do. 5. Courtnall Skosan Lions vs Highlanders Ellis Park July 30 Elton Jantjies initiated a super break from inside his own 22-metre area before freeing Skosan with a deft and perfectly timed pass. The wing finished in style. - TMG Sport
