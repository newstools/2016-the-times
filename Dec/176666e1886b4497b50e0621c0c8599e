The DA said on Thursday that it viewed the interdict aimed at excluding its shadow minister of communications Phumzile Van Damme and other members of the ad hoc committee from inquiring into the fitness of the SABC board as a last ditch attempt by one man seeking to cling to power for its sake . Maghuve seeks to thwart a legitimate parliamentary process designed to save the SABC from managerial collapse. As such the DA will argue for the inquiry to go ahead in order to restore the integrity of the national broadcaster which is what Parliament is seeking to do through the Ad Hoc Committee the DA added.
