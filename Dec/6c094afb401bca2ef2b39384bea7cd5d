It will be hot and it will be payday. That means stabbings, beatings, shootings and traffic accidents will spike.International and new local studies show what state hospital doctors have long experienced: wards fill up on payday weekends and are even busier when payday is part of a long weekend.People drink more on these days, which increases the incidence of violence and road accidents.Studies show that hot summer days are associated with more interpersonal violence, partly because people spend more time together. Most injuries are inflicted by friends or acquaintances.Short-term increases in temperature are associated with impaired decision making.Dr Karen Milford analysed the circumstances of patient admissions to Groote Schuur Academic Hospital's trauma ward over 17 months.She found that there had been 7350 injuries from "interpersonal violence" and 3188 resulting from car accidents.Her work has just been published in the SA Journal of Surgery.Milford's research showed that the number of patients with injuries sustained in car accidents increased in rainy weather and on weekend nights, especially around payday.Injuries as a result of violence increased at night, on weekends, on long weekends and on the weekend after payday.Milford said studies showed that alcohol consumption increased on weekends and around payday, with alcohol being the cause of between 23% and 68% of patients landing in the trauma unit for injuries caused by interpersonal violence.Her study also found that violence increased on hotter days."This is consistent with international studies. P eople spend more time socialising with friends and family in the warmer months, which leads to increased levels of assault. People are most likely to be assaulted by those they know."The study looked only at patients treated at Groote Schuur, in South Africa's murder capital, Cape Town."As a society and country, we have a lot of work to do to address the many underlying issues that lead to traumatic injury," Milford said.Health Department spokesman Joe Maila said: "We are always worried that violence increases at the end of month, on weekends and on Christmas Day. It costs the department a lot of money."People are taking up beds that could have been occupied by people with unavoidable illnesses."Milford hoped her findings can be used to help plan trauma ward staff assignments.
