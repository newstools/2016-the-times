AFASA secretary-general Aggrey Mahanjana said the situation in KwaZulu-Natal the Eastern Cape and Free State was worsening. Despite a few good rains across other parts of the country the Eastern Cape and Southern Free State in particular continue to be severely affected by the drought with Amathole Alfred Nzo Chris Hani Joe Gqabi and OR Tambo District Municipalities being the most affected he said. As a result farmers in these and other affected areas were severely struggling. The situation is worsening as the crippling drought persists. Most farmers are struggling to stay afloat and we urge the government to intervene immediately to save the situation. Failing to do so will result in undesired consequences. This is a black Christmas for farmers in these areas said Mahanjana. He warned that unless there was further government intervention their struggles would continue. Farmers have suffered the whole of 2016 and looks like the situation will continue into 2017. We have not yet been able to confirm how many animals have died yet however in January the reported animal death toll was more than 15 000. In addition to animal losses farmers this year have not been able to plant crops due to the dry conditions and are facing huge financial losses he said. - TMG Digital/The Times
