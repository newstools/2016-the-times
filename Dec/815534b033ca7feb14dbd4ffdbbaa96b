Caf nominated Mosimane in the coach of the year category while Sundowns are in the running for the club of the year award.Sundowns forced their way into the list after their triumphant march to the African Champions League title last month. Their continental triumph enabled the Brazilians to become the first SA club to participate in the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan.The other South Africans who received recognition from Caf on Sunday are Janine van Wyk in the women s player of the year category and Banyana Banyana in the race for the women s national team of the year award.Banyana qualified for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio and also managed to finish fourth at the African Women s Nations Cup in Cameroon this month.The Caf winners will be decided by votes from the continental body s technical and development media committees and a panel of 20 experts (Journalists TV consultants) except the fair play legend and platinum awards which are not subject to voting.Veteran Times Media journalist Mark Gleeson and respected SABC senior reporter Velile Mbalula are the only South Africans on the Caf voting pane.Eastern Cape-born Mbuli s rise is the stuff of legend as he joined the SABC as a 15-year-old in 1997 while he was still in high school.The hardworking and humble Mbuli who hails from the rolling hills of Ndabakazi Butterworth comes from humble beginnings and has become an inspiration to many youngsters who dream of a career in journalism. The story of Mamelodi Sundowns in 2016 is a culmination of work that Pitso Mosimane started four years ago and their ultimate goal has always been to conquer the continent Mbuli said from Japan on Sunday. I ve followed them very closely over the years and I believe this is just the beginning.
