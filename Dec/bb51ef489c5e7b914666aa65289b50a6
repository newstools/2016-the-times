Fredericks was reacting to a video on social media in which one of its stars, former prisoner David Manuel, was assaulted. He said he was "saddened" by the attack. Before the assault, Manuel's assailants flung insults at him. In the video, the attackers are heard saying the actor had made a "kak movie" about the Western Cape's notorious 28 gang. Manuel plays Freddie Gums, a gang leader in Pollsmoor prison, in Noem My Skollie. The film documents Fredericks' life story. It is set in the 1960s and centres on a group of teenagers who join a gang for protection. When one ends up in jail, he realises he has a gift for telling stories and becomes the "cinema" behind bars. It earns him respect and his friend becomes the concubine of the cell boss. "I was 17 and I lived that nightmare. I am telling a true story. He just portrayed the role and was very good. I don't know what started the [attack]," said Fredericks. "I think it is jealousy on the part of the attackers." He said Manuel took drama classes while he was in prison and had a bright future.But things are now looking up for Manuel, who lives in a township on the Cape Flats. Bradley Joshua, executive producer of Gambit Films, said that despite the attack Manuel was doing "okay" and was "already working on another film".Joshua's colleague, filmmaker Benjamin Overmeyer, has also helped guide Manuel in his new career and has secured him an agent.Joshua's brother, Daryne, was the director on Noem My Skollie. Joshua said they had cast Manuel in their next feature film. "This was a very unfortunate incident, but, on the positive side, things are materialising at the times that I have been interacting with him," said Joshua.
