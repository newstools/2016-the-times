Harty filed a defamation suit against South African Transport Workers Union (Satawu) officials Mathew Ramosie the union s national aviation coordinator who was ordered to pay R 150 000 plus interest and Nicholas Maziya the union s deputy national secretary for an article that was published by the Daily Maverick in March and on social media.The pair were ordered to pay a further R150 000 each plus interest for an article that was published on the Eyewitness News website and on social media.In the articles Ramosie and Maziya alleged that Harty had diverted a Hong Kong/Johannesburg SAA flight to Durban to drop off members of his family who were on board with him.Fedusa General Secretary Dennis George said the ruling handed down on Wednesday would force people to think carefully about what they post on social media as the matter "not only unduly defamed the decorated image of Senior Captain Hardy but likewise brought the frail image of SAA into disrepute once again".He slammed SAA management for doing nothing to help Harty during his "harrowing ordeal but instead allowed the hearsay matter to prolong without unearthing the critical evidence"."The entire ordeal was simply distasteful and unbecoming of the national carrier in its inconspicuous silence and unsupportive manner towards Senior Captain Harty who served the airline with distinction alongside the integral role he played as Chairperson of the Fedusa affiliated Airline Pilots Association of South Africa (ALPA SA) " George said.He added that the ruling would go a long way in addressing governance issues at SAA and other state-owned enterprises such as the SABC. "We have always had full confidence in Senior Captain John Harty as a man of integrity who put the interest of the national carrier first and above everything else." - TMG Digital
