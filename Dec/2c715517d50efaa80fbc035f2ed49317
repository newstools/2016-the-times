Shortly after the incident, Cassper took to Twitter to express his disappointment."I'm in the club celebrating hard work and someone calls me saying they found someone keying my brand-new car. Mara why do have to do this? Such a beautiful night? To end like this? I worked so hard this year, not only to get what I have but to stay out of trouble. Then this?" Cassper tweeted.The rapper alleged that security guards at the club let the culprit go and that he didn't get any joy out of the police.However, he said he hoped justice would prevail.When I think about how many times I've come to the police station to report a crime and nothing ever happens. Had a gun to my face 1s and I really hope that justice will prevail this time. I opened a case &amp; hopefully I will be remunerated of my hard work. Modimo o phala Baloyi!This, he said, was the reason he was afraid to share pictures of his cars and fancy watches on social media.A few days ago I tweeted that I don't want to post my cars and jewelry because it breeds envy and a lot of fans didn't understand, well...Ai people are evil guys. Kore the times we live in. I don't know what to say but it's scary.When contacted for comment on Thursday, Cassper's management confirmed the incident but said they could not comment as the matter was being investigated by the police.The Doc Shebeleza hitmaker purchased his second Bentley, valued at R3.7-million, just one month ago.At the time Sandton car dealership Prestige Marques confirmed to TshisaLIVE that it was the second Bentley it had sourced for Cassper in six months.A photo posted by Prestige Marques (@prestige_marques) on Nov 14, 2016 at 7:15am PST
