Economic Development Agriculture and Tourism MEC Alan Winde presented the plans to the provincial legislature. We are making progress in terms of the establishment of our Madiba Heritage Tourism Route... R1 7-million will be allocated to fund the memorial statue of former president Nelson Mandela at the City Hall said Winde.Winde announced the route last year. It will include Robben Island Pollsmoor Prison Drakenstein Correctional Services Cape Town City hall and Parliament.The statue will be a replica of the photograph of Mandela standing on the city hall balcony making his first speech after he was released from prison in 1990. I think everyone in this house will know the speech that Madiba made on the balcony of the City Hall. And you all know what that photograph looks like; what those paintings look like where Madiba was standing on that balcony with all the people standing around him and hanging on the balcony he said.Winde said the statue will help tourists experience "that specific moment of our history .Last year the city unveiled a bust of the former president at the same venue during an event attended by anti-apartheid struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada who was jailed with Mandela at Robben Island.Another Mandela bust was erected near the entrance of the National Assembly in 2014.
