According to Daily Sun, Ngizwe and his first wife Sphelele Nxumalo celebrated their anniversary by renewing their wedding vows in an intimate traditional ceremony held in Zola, Soweto.Speaking to the paper, Sphelele said that the couple had decided to renew their vows after going through a rough patch recently."We've been through a lot but we survived and that is why we chose to celebrate our 10th anniversary this way. That is how love is. It has its ups and downs but it stays strong," she said.The paper also claimed that neither of Ngizwe's other two wives were present for the renewal ceremony.The couple's relationship made headlines last year after IOL reported that Sphelele had apparently taken the DJ to court in an attempt to nullify his marriages to his other wives. She claimed that she had been alerted to one of Ngizwe's marriages via Whatsapp.There have been conflicting reports on the court's decision.Drum recently reported that the radio star had finally traditionally married his third wife, despite protest from his other two wives. They claimed that he had not invited the other wives to the ceremony.
