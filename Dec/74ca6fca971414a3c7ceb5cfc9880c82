Emtee has had his fair share of critics over the last few months and speaking to TshishaLIVE this week he said that one particular criticism annoys him the most."People say that I am a 'wack' rapper but no one has ever had the guts to tell me that to my face. I'm not a 'wack rapper', and if they want to say that they must come say that to my face," Emtee said angrily.Emtee said that he was often seen as "soft" because of his laid-back personality.But the rapper claimed that he can be aggressive when pushed."I'm from the hood. I'm a hood hero. I know some hard people. People must not think that I'm a pushover because they will see. I don't need my team. I will sort people out on my own. It's all me," the Roll Up rapper added.And while Emtee doesn't mind the fame, he said that he doesn't like how people constantly tries to pick a fight with him just because he is in the spotlight."I'm just trying to do me. I'm nowhere near where I want to be and people see me hustling to get my mama a house and they still come after me," he said.
