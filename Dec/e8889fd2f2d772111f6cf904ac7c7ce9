Komphela's most recent exits from stadiums have been in the company of police and security personnel, and the 49-year-old admitted yesterday that he was going through ''hell".He said: ''Sometimes when I go through pressure and hell, it is about who do I represent.''Sometimes you have to take fire not because you deserve to be burnt, but you take fire because you take fire on behalf of [the club]. And when you suffer on behalf of [the club] you suffer with pleasure."He added: ''When Mandela went 30 years in prison, if he had known that he was doing it [to serve this lengthy sentence], he would have come out on the first day or even, heaven forbid, committed suicide. But because he knew that he was fighting for a cause... that inspired him.''So the pain that I am going through, I am going through it on behalf of the supporters and everybody here [at Kaizer Chiefs], but it is not nice."The once all-conquering Amakhosi are a shadow of their former dominant selves and are seventh on the Premier Soccer League log standings, having played 12 matches, won four, drawn five and lost three.The coach admitted that he was approaching tomorrow's match against the 12th-placed Bloemfontein Celtic with some degree of trepidation.Komphela said though the past few weeks had been difficult, quitting was furthest from his mind. - TMG Digital
