 Michael is a veteran councillor who has served for the past 10 years. He has what it takes he is a strong leader and we believe that he has what it takes to take the municipality from strength to strength said Gauteng DA leader John Moodey on Tuesday.He added that Holenstein was more than ready for his new role and had already sold his business De Hoek Country Hotel in Mogale city ahead of the vote.Pannall who is a member of the DA was voted into office in August through a coalition between the DA IFP and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and resigned due to ill health on Thursday.The Mogale council will have an urgent meeting on Wednesday when councillors will vote for the municipality's new mayor.Moodey has previously said he was confident that the municipality's new mayor would once again be from the DA a statement backed by the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) which said it would vote with the DA.The IFP is the kingmaker in the council with its one councillor holding the deciding vote between the African National Congress's (ANC) 38 votes and the DA and Economic Freedom Fighters' 38 combined votes.The ANC on the other hand was not as forthcoming with information on its candidate choosing to wait until Wednesday to reveal whose name the party will put forward.However word was that the council's current speaker Patrick Naga Lipudi was the top contender from the party. I can't confirm I can't say yes or no because the speaker is also a member of the [ANC] Provincial Executive Committee said West Rand ANC spokesman Refentse Mangope.He said the ANC was still deliberating on who to put forward and the party's leadership had yet to decide. Discussions are still hot .TMG Digital/BusinessLive
