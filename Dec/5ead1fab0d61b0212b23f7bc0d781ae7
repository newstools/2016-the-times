WE HAVE long thought it to be true. But now we have no excuse. International literature and new local research show what government doctors have long experienced: Hospital wards fill up on payday weekends and are even busier when long weekends fall on a payday and when the weather is hot.This coming weekend, medics are bracing for a torrid time as the weather service predicts hot weather, it is payday, a long weekend and the start of the Christmas holidays. Sadly, the mayhem will not be confined to the weekend as our festive season road-death history is likely to repeat itself. Between December 1 last year and January 11, there were 1253 crashes, up by 11% since the previous period. The death toll over the same period stood at 1755, 220 more than the previous year. This is just road crashes and does not account for the interpersonal violence - stabbings, gunshots and assaults - that often come with our alcohol-fuelled revelry.The crime stats do not break down these incidents between those that occur over the festive season versus those that do not but it stands to reason that these will be high.We can blame it on shortlived awareness campaigns that are predominantly launched and run over specific periods and on the South African Police Service for not being in the right place at the right time.We can blame it on those traffic police officers who turn a blind eye to road traffic infringements and take "cooldrink" money instead of arresting speedsters.But we should be looking at ourselves more closely.The only way that we will be able to bring down the number of fatalities on our roads and injuries and deaths at our own hands is if we start taking responsibility for our actions.Take an Uber if you have had too much to drink. Rest if you are tired on the road instead of speeding up. Walk away from that argument. It is not worth your life.
