Chairperson Andrew Mlangeni on Tuesday confirmed that there would be another meeting scheduled after Saturday s initial much-anticipated meeting between Zuma and members of the committee who include former National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala.Mlangeni was tight-lipped about Saturday s meeting but said another engagement was definitely in the committee s plans. I am not at liberty to divulge what we discussed during the meeting except to say we discussed the affairs and issues affecting the ANC. What I can tell you is that there will be another meeting but we have not yet agreed on a date time and place at which we will meet but we have agreed that there will be another meeting said Mlangeni.Speculation had been rife in the days leading up to Saturday s meeting that Zuma was expected to answer some tough questions in connection with observations contained in the State of Capture report suggesting that there may have been some veracity to allegations of state capture by the controversial Gupta family courtesy of their close links with Zuma.The report called for Zuma to institute a judicial commission of inquiry but the president has made clear his intention to take the report up for a judicial review on the grounds that former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela could not instruct him to institute a commission of inquiry and that Madonsela should have allowed her successor Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane to continue with the state capture investigation.Meanwhile the DA announced on Monday that it has filed papers in the Constitutional Court seeking an order that Zuma failed to implement Madonsela s remedial action to the effect that he institute a judicial commission by December 2.The party said it was not satisfied that Zuma had merely given notice to take Madonsela s report for judicial review.
