Various items including drugs and a firearm were seized. When the South African Police Service launched our Safer Festive Season operations formally on 14 November 2016 we committed ourselves to being more visible over the holiday season and the Eastern Cape is certainly living up to that commitment Phahlane said. During these holidays we urge the communities to act responsibly. The excessive use of alcohol not only leads to death on our roads but also to the increase in certain crime trends such as murder assault rape and domestic violence. We also see an increase in drownings. By acting responsibly our communities can ensure that a safe and peaceful holiday season is enjoyed by all. The Herald
