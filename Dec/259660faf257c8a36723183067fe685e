MPs in the ad hoc committee set up to investigate the SABC board accused Maguvhe of disrespecting Parliament and delaying proceedings.The hearings were supposed to start on Wednesday morning with the Auditor-General and Independent Communications Authority of SA.At the beginning of the meeting chairperson Vincent Smith told MPs of the latest developments which could affect the inquiry. Yesterday afternoon I was informed that Prof Maguvhe has filed leave to appeal (Judge Siraj) Desai s decision on Friday. I am not aware that court has given its reason for the finding. If that is the position the court has not given its decision I m not clear on what basis this (appeal) could have been made Smith told the committee.Economic Freedom Fighters MP Fana Mokoena told the committee that Maguvhe was being absolutely rebellious by appealing and by refusing to release documents to parliament. Mr Maguvhe must be held personally liable for delaying proceedings said Mokoena.Maguvhe group executive of corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng and acting CEO James Aguma were all in attendance.MPs will now go into a closed meeting with legal advisors and senior counsel to decide on a way forward.
