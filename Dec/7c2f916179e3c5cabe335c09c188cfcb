This is according to mayor Solly Msimanga, who addressed reporters at his Centurion offices yesterday."We inherited what can only be described as a mess, with unlawful contracts and costly projects," Msimanga said.Three forensic investigations had now been launched, he said, and the first one would look into the 2014 Tribe One Dinokeng festival debacle, which cost the city R65-million.US rapper Nicki Minaj was paid a R10-million non-refundable appearance fee, but the festival was cancelled.Msimanga revealed that his administration was investigating "ghost" employees in the metro."We will be looking into how this affects the city," he said.Msimanga said the previous administration paid a contractor R100-million to build a power substation in Mamelodi that never materialised.The municipality was also trying to get out of a 2013 smart metre contract that was unlawfully concluded, the mayor said.The company, PEU Capital Partners, has been paid over R2-billion since 2013, according to the metro."The city has been haemorrhaging funds that could otherwise be used for services," said Msimanga.
