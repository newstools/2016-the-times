Mabokgwane a Bafana Bafana international was at fault for the equalising goal that allowed Celtic back into the match after Oupa Manyisa s 1-0 first-half lead.The 28-year-old goalkeeper lifted his arms to indicate he was allowing a long ball from Lantshene Phalane to run out and then watched in horror as it went over his head and into the back of the net.He has now taken full responsibility."I'd like to officially offer my sincere apologies to the Pirates family chairman (Irvin Khoza) my colleagues management technical team and supporters for the error I committed in our match against Celtics " Mabokgwane told Times Media Digital."Words can't express the pain I caused for everyone."I own up to the loss and promise not to let them down again in that manner."Mabokgwane has in recent times donned the number one jersey at the club and produced some eye catching performances before the howler against Celtic.The Limpopo-born goalkeeper kept two clean sheets in his first two matches against Free State Stars and Chippa United.He has conceded only four goals in five matches since he got his break. - TMG Digital
