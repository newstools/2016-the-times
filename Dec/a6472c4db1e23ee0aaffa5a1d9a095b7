Before his controversial tweets were published Euphonik tweeted about Nasty C and how his new music is all about the bars and not the cars.Twitter detectives took the comment as a swipe at AKA who is dating Euphonik s ex Bonang. (Just two days earlier AKA had tweeted an image of a new car that he had purchased).The message was retweeted over 500 times and his mentions were inundated with comments about how he can t get over Bonang how he hasn t moved on and how he is jealous."The funny thing is that he genuinely wasn t even referring to AKA. He was making a comment in general. He also has fancy cars so he was also referring to himself. He has no problem with AKA at all " one source close to Euphonik told TshisaLIVE.After the barrage of messages Euphonik couldn t hold his tongue and decided to set the record straight in seven, now popular, points:Euphonik was widely condemned for his messages with many calling him out for being sexist saying he had reduced Bonang to the number of men she had been in relationships with.However, DJ Fresh came out in defence of the DJ saying he knew that the explicit remarks were addressed to Twitter trolls and not the whole of South Africa.A few days later, Euphonik cashed in on the #Nonke trend by launching a range of T-Shirts with the phrase written on it."I don't take things seriously and so when I saw that my comments, and in particular the phrase Nonke, had trended for seven days straight, the businessman inside of me told me to try commercialise it," he told TshisaLIVE.In the weeks that followed, he unveiled his range of Nonke t-shirts, which went on sale at his Debut clothing store in Johannesburg for R299. And in just three months, the t-shirts were officially sold out, with there being no word on whether more stock would be manufactured.
