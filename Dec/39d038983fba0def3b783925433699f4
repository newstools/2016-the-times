The apocalyptic scene tearing through the fireworks market in the Mexico City suburb of Tultepec struck terror into witnesses' hearts. The series of massive explosions killed at least 29 people, injuring dozens and leaving the market a charred wasteland."The earth moved," said Angelica Coss, a 25-year-old resident who lives just streets away from the market. "It felt like a plane had crashed, like bombs were being dropped.""I went up to the roof of my place and others were already there and we saw the market was blowing up. And all the smoke started to cover us," she said.A video posted by Anunnaki Enlil (@enlilanunnaki) on Dec 20, 2016 at 1:01pm PST Inside the San Pablito market itself -- Mexico's biggest with 300 stands selling tons of pyrotechnics -- horror was unfolding."You just heard the blast. And everything started to be on fire. People came running out on fire," Walter Garduno said."People were alight -- children," he added before trailing off.Pops and thuds of multiple fireworks went off, sending flaming rockets into a busy crowd that had been shopping for Christmas and New Year's festivities.The devastation reduced the market to a smoldering wasteland of ash, charred metal and concrete.Some 13 children suffered burns to more than 90 percent of their bodies and were being sent to the U.S. city of Galveston in Texas for treatment, said Eruviel Avila, the governor of the State of Mexico in which Tultepec is located.He put the death toll at 29, saying that 26 died at the scene of the explosions and another three died later in local hospitals.Avila also vowed to find and punish those responsible and to provide economic assistance to those who had lost their livelihoods.The federal attorney general's office also opened an investigation, saying in a statement that six separate blasts caused the destruction.Acuden 10 ambulancias de @CruzRojaEM con 50 param dicos al incendio en el mercado de cohetes de #Tultepec. pic.twitter.com/N0VucD83GEIsidro Sanchez, the head of Tultepec emergency services, said earlier that a lack of safety measures was the likely cause of the blasts.The federal police said a forensic team had been sent to investigate and that at least 70 people had been injured. Videos from the scene showed people frantically fleeing, while aerial footage revealed blackened stalls and a flattened tangle of metal and wood.More than 80 percent of the 300 stalls at the market were destroyed by the explosions, said state official Jose Manzur.It was another cruel blow to San Pablito, which had already suffered runaway conflagrations in 2005 and 2006.Its vendors -- who operated with licenses issued by the defense ministry -- had boasted theirs was Latin America's safest fireworks fair.But that claim was proven wrong when fireworks somewhere in the market ignited, setting off the catastrophic chain reaction that consumed the place within minutes.First responders were initially stymied by the continuous blasts going off in different parts of the market, spread over four hectares (10 acres) next to a traffic intersection.The smoke choked them as they pulled out dozens of wounded people, most of them suffering burns.One of the first to dive into the disaster zone was Victor Hugo Samantes, whose relatives worked in some of the market stalls. They all managed to escape."It's incredible because you're used to seeing everything happening, people working, manning their stalls," he said, a mask covering his mouth. "And now, to see it like this..."
