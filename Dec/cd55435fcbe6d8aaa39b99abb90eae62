Phil Molefe the SABC s former acting group chief executive was today addressing the committee set up as part of Parliament s inquiry into the SABC. The former acting CEO and journalist told the committee that Motsoeneng had been appointed to the senior positions in November 2011. Molefe told the ad hoc committee of various oversights in governance norms during his time as acting CEO including that Motsoeneng was allowed to sit in on board meetings despite not being a board member. He recalled that in October 2011 he was travelling to Accra on business and recommended two seniors at the SABC to act as CEO in his absence. While he was away he was told that Motsoeneng was named acting CEO. This critical appointment was made without the knowledge of the group CEO as I was away travelling said Molefe. The only conclusion one could make is that this was pushed forward because I was vehemently against his appointment. Molefe said that during his time at the SABC he discovered that Motsoeneng had powerful supporters in the organisation including Ben Ngubane the former chairperson of the public broadcaster.He told the ad hoc committee that Motsoeneng had personally asked him for a salary increase when he was a junior employee at the SABC. Molefe said he refused the request because only the board could approve it. Another unusual Motsoeneng move was his railroading through a deal between the SABC and the Gupta-owned newspaper New Age to broadcast a series of sponsored business breakfasts. Molefe told the committee he had unsuccessfully applied to become permanent CEO at the SABC and that he was eventually pushed out of the public broadcaster.
