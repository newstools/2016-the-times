In a statement current mayoral spokesperson Zara Nicholson said the mayor fondly referred to Otter as 'Stevovo' or 'my pavement special' in reference to his eccentric nature . I have known and worked with dear Stevovo for many years and he was truly a one of a kind person whose dedication was certainly one of his greatest traits. He will be sorely missed said De Lille. We extend our deepest condolences to his ex-wife Janine Lange and their young daughter Mya 6 family colleagues and friends. You are in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. Otter was working for the city as the head of community engagement for Transport for Cape Town. The city said Otter had found his niche in TCT and was always focused on ensuring a fair outcome for the most vulnerable and marginalised. Councillor Brett Herron who heads the city transport department said: It will be impossible to replace the kind of passion care and commitment he displayed. Otter is a former journalist who was well known in media circles. He got tongues wagging for walking barefoot in the office while wearing a suit. Otter has also published a book entitled Mlungu in the Township which detailed his time living in Khayelitsha. TMG Digital/Sunday Times
