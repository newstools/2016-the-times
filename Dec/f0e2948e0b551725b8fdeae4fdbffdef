Two men - believed to be brothers - related to African National Congress (ANC) PR councillor Boy Shozi were ambushed and gunned down by unknown assailants.Ndumiso Shozi 27 and Thobani Shozi 25 were killed on Monday night in Ward 4 in what is believed to be the continuation of an escalating turmoil in the troubled area.Their cousin Philani Shozi 24 escaped with gunshot injuries and is in hospital.KwaZulu-Natal police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said both victims sustained gunshot wounds to the head and chest.She said police are investigating the motive behind the killings. Charges of murder and attempted murder have been opened at the Inchanga police station she said.The latest killings follow that of the South African Communist Party s (SACP) Nontsikelelo Blose 40 and the ANC s Xolani Ngcobo 38 who were killed 24 hours apart in Inchanga in August.Councillor Shozi was not immediately available for comment.The fear and tension remain palpable in an area where comrades differences are solved through the barrel of a gun.Prior to these killings many other people lost their lives in Inchanga in 2016 alone including the SACP s Phillip Dlamini 68 Bongani Hlatshwayo 38 killed in January; and Siyabonga Ngubo 38 killed on May.Magazini Shange survived the killing in May.So heightened has been the tensions in Inchanga this year that SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande President Jacob Zuma and national executive member Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma have also made stopovers or visited the area.An ANC-SACP two-a-side committee to resolve the impasse was established and police task team assigned to investigate the killing.At least eight houses were torched in August during the violence following the murder of Blose and Ngcobo forcing several families to flee their homes.
