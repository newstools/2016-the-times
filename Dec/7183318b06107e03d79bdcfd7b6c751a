Palacios has spoken openly about a lack of character and a will to die for the jersey among Pirates current generation who find themselves in 10th place as the PSL goes into its current six-week break.He has also strongly hinted at disciplinary and lifestyle issues among some of his players.Bucs administrative officer Floyd Mbele said the club will examine Palacios s half-season technical report to establish the facts and whether there have been isolated incidents or a wider problem. I m not aware that there is a problem to be honest " Mbele said."I think that Augusto may have made an observation we obviously would need to have a look at his report to see what he has submitted for the two months he has been there. But let s interrogate it."Are we over-reacting to one incident?"It s like saying players drink we have a classic situation with Wayne Rooney in England now. Are we talking about the player going to get a couple of pints of beer drinking?"What is it that we are talking about? Is it something that has inherently been there or is it an observation on one or two instances in which case let us deal with the perpetrators and move on. But I am a bit wary about painting everybody with the same brush when in fact it may be one or two isolated incidents that in effect would need to be dealt with at the level of the technical committee where the coaches should be able to deal with it. I don t want to sit down and cast aspersions about the discipline in the team when it s maybe one player who was drinking two pints of beer after a match."Then what are we really going to be creating an issue over that? Then it s something that can be dealt with between the player the coach and the club. Obviously if it happens over a period of time then certainly let the management be made aware and let us deal with it through our internal processes of the club. Pirates return to action on Wednesday February 8 against Platinum Stars at Royal Bafokeng Stadium. - TMG Digital
