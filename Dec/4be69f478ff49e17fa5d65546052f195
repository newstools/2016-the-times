Tessa Gopal who was awarded Lawyer of the Year: Civil award at a recent achiever awards ceremony acted for the minor biological mother whose mother gave consent for her granddaughter to be adopted.Section 230(3) of the Children s Act requires consent by the grandmother where the biological mother is a minor.The grandmother supported the adoption of her grandchild by her employers.She had on behalf of her minor daughter signed consent for the adoption as per the requirements of the Children s Act.The biological mother opposed the adoptive parents and approached Legal Aid SA for assistance.The Children s Court refused the adoption on the basis that the grandmother as guardian of the biological mother had no authority to grant permission on behalf of the biological mother.The court held that the support by an adult needed in terms of the Act for an adoption where the mother is a minor does not replace or take away the mother s need for consent to the adoption.The court ruled that the baby was not adoptable in terms of the act due to the fact that maternal consent was not obtained.The adoptive parents were dissatisfied with the ruling of the court and took the decision on review to the High Court in Durban.The court ordered that the biological mother must have structured contact with her child and ruled that the application for adoption be revisited after a period of two years.After the two-year period the family advocate furnished the report which still supported its earlier recommendation that the consent of the biological mother cannot be replaced.Legal Aid SA said the minor mother of the baby would not have been in a position to resist the pressure by her family if she had no access to legal representation provided by Legal Aid SA. The possibility that the child would have been adopted was very real Legal Aid SA spokeswoman Malebogo Mahape-Marimo said on Tuesday. - TMG Digital
