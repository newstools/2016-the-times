"This is a chilling realisation of the dangers women face in their own communities even more so for women from the LGBTQI community " Dan Plato Western Cape Minister of Community Safety said on Monday.The attack took place in Driftsands near Khayelitsha Cape Town.Plato said those responsible for this murder in cold blood need to face the full might of the law. "There is no space in our communities for violence let alone the reported level of abuse brutality and injustice Ms Swelindawo has been subjected to."He promised to ask the Provincial Police Commissioner to help ensure that the necessary investigations and resources are made available to ensure justice for Swelindawo and appealed to the community of Driftsands to help find the perpetrators of "this abnormal crime"."We cannot remain silent about the evil and injustice committed by a few. It is time the silent majority speak out and break the hold that those who threaten the safety in our communities have over us " said Plato.The murder began trending on Twitter on Monday as South Africans reacted with anger revulsion and sadness.Mlungisi_prince @mlungisi_prince said: "To be lesbian in South Africa is a death sentence it seems".To be lesbian in South Africa is a death sentence it seems #NoluvoSwelindawo mlungisi_prince (@mlungisi_prince) December 5, 2016 To be lesbian in South Africa is a death sentence it seems #NoluvoSwelindawo"We fail black lesbians every single day with our silence.
