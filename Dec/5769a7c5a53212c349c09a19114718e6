In the past year Zizo and Mayihlome have quickly become one of Mzansi's favourite celebrity couples.And even though at first they were protective of their personal lives, over the past year they have definitely stepped out of their shells. These days their social media accounts are overflowing with super sweet posts about each other. So it comes as no surprise that Zizo poured her heart out about her man on his birthday recently. "Happy Birthday to the most amazing husband and Father. My heart is 100% full of love for you and our son. I say a million prayers a day for you both. Happy Birthday Thangana wam," she said. Aww!
