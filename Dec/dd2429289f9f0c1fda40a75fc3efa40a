Last year they filed an application against the government and the head of the prison after receiving complaints of severe overcrowding and appalling conditions at the facility which is used to house detainees awaiting trial.The NGO was represented by Lawyers for Human Rights and has been tracking conditions at the prison since 2014. They found that it was operating at 249% of capacity and that detainees were deprived of basic amenities including nutrition ablution facilities and healthcare services.The court ordered the government to develop a comprehensive plan including time frames to address the problems at the facility which it said were inconsistent with the Constitution.According to the law detainees must be held under conditions of human dignity and should be provided with a diet to promote good health and an opportunity to exercise.-TMG Digital/Cape Newsroom
