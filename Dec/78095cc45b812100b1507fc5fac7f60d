 Lastborn as Tete is affectionately known cracked the nod in two categories at a nominations ceremony held at Sascoc House in Johannesburg this week.Tete was nominated for the Male Boxer of the Year and the Knockout Match of the Year while his manager Tengimfene emerged as a nominee in the Manager of the Year category.Tete was nominated alongside Simphiwe Konco and Xolisani "Nomeva" Ndongeni.But both Tengimfene and Tete were not present at the nominations ceremony as they are in the final stages of preparation for the bantamweight boxer s January bout. We are very happy that Tete has been nominated " said Tengimfene."The mere fact that he got onto the nomination list tells us that someone is recognising his excellence."We wish Boxing SA continues to honour young and upcoming talent. Look we think that Tete actually has an edge to win this award."He s been competing at a higher level than any South African boxer you can think of. He s fought more than half of his 10 bouts in the last year or so outside of the country so that tells you that he s in a different league."Tete is hard at training in the gym to get in the right shape for the WBO bantamweight championship fight against holder Marlon Tapales from the Philippines.Tengimfene said the fight would happen on January 28 the same day the Awards ceremony will be held at Durban s ICC.Tengimfene was also nominated alongside industry colleagues Luyanda Sovasi and Benny Pelman in the Manager of the Year category. - TMG Digital
