 Electricity theft remains one of the least reported crimes in South Africa despite the fact that an alarmingly high number of people pets and livestock are killed every year as a result of illegal connections improper house wiring cable theft and low hanging conductors said General Manager for Eskom in Kwazulu-Natal Monde Bala. South Africans are a passionate people who have in the past rallied to the aid of those who might not be able to defend themselves. We can see this today in the fight against atrocities such as rhino poaching. However we are yet to see a similar display of passion and activism in the fight against electricity theft a crime which year after year claims the lives of innocent people in many communities across the country. We wish to see all residents rising to the call to take an active stand against this crime by reporting suspected acts of electricity or cable theft to Operation Khanyisa.
