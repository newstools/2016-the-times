Maguvhe was speaking at a press briefing in Cape Town on Wednesday following an SABC delegation s walkout from the committee assessing the fitness of the public broadcaster's board to hold office.The SABC chair said he will wait for the SABC's appointing authority to release him from office."In 2013 I got an appointment letter from the appointing authority that I must serve on the SABC board. To date I have not received any letter from the appointing authority that says my services are terminated. If the appointing authority no longer needs my services I am sure the letter will be coming from that appointing authority to me to say I am terminating your services. I don t see why I should resign because I never appointed myself. I am waiting for that letter to say you have worked thus far can you please step down " Maguvhe said.Maguvhe is the only non-executive board member left after a string of resignations over the past few weeks.He also added that he was concerned that no board has served its full term at the SABC since the dawn of democracy."The question is that are all these men and women unfit? This is the questions that we should leave to the public. Something is wrong and this should be corrected because I believe there will be no board that serves its full term " he said.The SABC's chair together with a number of executives including acting SABC CEO James Aguma and head of corporate affairs Hlaudi Motsoeneng walked out of the committee after Maguvhe's request to have the an ICASA and the Auditor General's reports translated into braille were turned down.
