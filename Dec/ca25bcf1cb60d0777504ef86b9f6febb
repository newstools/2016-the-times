He is alleged to have been involved in corruption in the police's forensic division.Speaking at a press conference in Pretoria yesterday, Phahlane criticised his detractors, saying those who accused him wanted to divert attention from themselves by implicating him in wrongdoing.Phahlane did not release the full forensic audit report - compiled by CPN Forensic and Accounting Services and completed two years ago - merely a summary of the findings, which were to the effect that the allegations against him were unfounded.The Independent Police Investigative Directorate is investigating allegations that Phahlane, who headed the forensic division, had attempted to defeat the ends of justice.The allegations relate to claims that Phahlane told witnesses not to speak out about corruption in the division.He is also alleged to have received millions of rands in kickbacks in return for awarding a tender for the provision of services to the forensic division, spending the money on renovations to his home.The allegations against Phahlane were brought to the attention of now suspended national police commissioner Riah Phiyega in 2012."These allegations have been circulating for years," he said. "It is important to set the record straight once and for all."He said he had received the report a year after it had been completed.Phahlane said the allegations had been made by the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union, and by police officers."It turns out that those who made the allegations were at the time under investigation for misconduct. This was to divert attention from themselves."
