Despite it all, AKA and B are stronger than ever with sources close to the couple telling us that they realise that if they've made it through 2016, they feel almost unbreakable."They support it each in everything that they do. They are both really busy and it really is a matter of putting time together in their schedules. But they go the extra mile for each other," said our source.Probably the best thing they could have done is come out with their love and it show-off. No more hiding. No more dodging the rumours. And SA, mostly, has welcomed it.So, in no particular order, check out some of their moved loved-up snaps.A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Oct 28, 2016 at 12:55am PDTA photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Oct 11, 2016 at 12:14pm PDT A photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Sep 7, 2016 at 11:43am PDTA photo posted by Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Sep 3, 2016 at 11:59am PDT
