I m not sure if you know but Collins went for a knee operation on Monday Highlands Igesund told reporters on Wednesday evening after winning his first league match in charge since taking over in October. So he s been out of hospital now for just one day and obviously we re looking for a quick recovery from him. We miss him a lot because he holds up the ball so well for us. It s not a major operation where players go out for six months with cruciate ligaments. We expect Mbesuma to be out for a period of between six to eight months and then start with some little bit of rehabilitation. He s been playing with that injury you know but his mobility wasn t very good because of the injury. So we had a specialist check it out and I m hoping that he recovers quicker.
