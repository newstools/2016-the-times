As president, it may prove one of his major liabilities, presidential historians warn.Interviews with a dozen people familiar with how Trump conducts business reveal the president-elect as a micromanager who regularly spars over details about decor in projects across his real estate and branding empire.Trump announced on Wednesday that he would leave his businesses "in total" so that he could focus on the presidency.But those who have worked with him say a lifetime habit of micro-managing may be difficult to break, providing ammunition for critics who say his decisions as president will be driven by his private interests.He should avoid the example of President Jimmy Carter, another famous micromanager, who spent his first months in office poring over the White House tennis court schedule, said political scientist Ross Baker .Micromanagers rarely make successful presidents, said political scientist Rick Ghere. To be effective, presidents must delegate authority to members of their cabinet and rely on a range of expertise, he said. - Reuters
