 In view of the dysfunctionality mismanagement and widespread corruption allegations of key State Owned Corporations we urge that Parliament carry out inquiries into Eskom Transnet Denel PetroSA and the SAA the party said on Saturday.It was speaking after its two-day annual Augmented Central Committee (ACC) meeting which took place in Randburg on Thursday and Friday.The party said it believed that the parliamentary inquiry into the SABC board s fitness would contribute to re-building the confidence of the people in the ANC and parliament. As the SACP has long been saying the SABC is utterly dysfunctional and corrupt as is being glaringly revealed by the long-overdue Parliamentary Ad Hoc Committee inquiry into the SABC. We want to see decisive action taken against those responsible for this including criminal prosecution the SACP said. Multi-Choice and Naspers have played a major role in the crisis in the SABC and we believe that the parliamentary inquiry needs to call Mr Koos Bekker and Mr Imtiaz Patel to answer for their part in this the party charged. As we have repeatedly said we believe that they have unduly influenced the Department of Communications approach to the Set Top Box policy in order to retain MultiChoice s 98 percent monopoly of the Pay-TV sector. This is against ANC policies that would have transformed the sector and benefitted new emerging entrepreneurs. We also believe that the Parliamentary inquiry should consider recommending the scrapping of the illegitimate Multi-Choice-SABC Agreement the SACP said.
