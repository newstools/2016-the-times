South Africa, which has the continent's only nuclear power station, has earmarked nuclear expansion as the centrepiece of a plan to increase power generation to ease the country's reliance on ageing coal-fired plants and has asked Eskom to procure an additional 9600MW of capacity.However, the move is being opposed by environmental and clean-energy groups, while economists have said South Africa cannot afford to build new nuclear plants.The announcement comes just weeks after Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson published the "base case" of the integrated resource plan, which sets out the country's energy mix.In it the department admits that South Africa will not need nuclear power on-stream until 2037.The plan also paves the way for gas and renewables to provide the biggest chunk of new installed capacity by 2050.Eskom acting CEO Matshela Koko, speaking to reporters in Cape Town on the sidelines of a court case in which campaigners are challenging the government's decision, said the nuclear regulator's approval of the plan last week meant the state-owned company could proceed with the tender.
