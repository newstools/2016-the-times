Shields clocked the fastest time of Friday night s semifinals winning the second heat in 22.38sec to edge himself into the top seed position ahead of the South African winner of the first race in 22.41.Le Clos who retained his 100m and 200m butterfly crowns this week with Shields finishing second on both occasions is ranked No1 in the world in this event with 22.06.He also holds the 21.95 championship record he set two years ago.But Shields proved his worth as a sprinter by going faster than Le Clos in the men s 4x50m freestyle relay where South Africa short one genuine speedster ended sixth in 1min 25.61sec after leading at the halfway mark.Brad Tandy sixth in the 50m freestyle at the Olympics put SA into the lead in the opening leg with his 21.34sec; what a pity he didn t produce that time in Thursday s 50m freestyle heats where he failed to progress to the semifinals. That effort would have qualified him for the final.Le Clos kept SA in the lead with his 20.83 split the fourth-fastest swim of the night.Shields was the quickest going 20.58 as he anchored the US team to the silver medal having dived into the water in fifth position. Shinri Shioura of third-placed Japan went 20.60 and Vladimir Morozov of champions Russia was 20.71.Doug Erasmus another of SA s Olympians clocked 21.21 in the third leg as SA slipped to second spot but the 22.23 by young Eben Vorster turned out to be the slowest split of the night.Had veteran Roland Schoeman been in the team and had he reproduced his best time of this year SA might have had a chance of a bronze.At the previous world short course championships in 2014 SA ended fourth in the 4x200m freestyle relay having led going into the final leg and they would have won had veteran Darian Townsend been swimming for them instead of competing for the US the winners that night.There was another possible lost medal due to immigration on Friday night; American teen star Michael Andrew whose South African parents moved to the US years ago won the 100m individual medley. - TMG Digital
