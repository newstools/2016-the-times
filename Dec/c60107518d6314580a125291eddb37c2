Majavu was commenting following the judgment in the Western Cape High Court on Monday which set aside the disciplinary proceedings against Motsoeneng last year and ordered that the SABC commence new proceedings against him.It also set aside the decision taken in September to appoint Motsoeneng as the SABC s group executive of corporate affairs.Motsoeneng will however not find himself in the unemployment queue. He is still receiving his salary which is well above R2-million annually.Majavu told TMG Digital on Tuesday that strictly speaking the judgment did not prevent his client from going to work. However he had advised him against doing so.Majavu said he was waiting for the SABC to tell his client what its intentions are following the damning judgment. I wrote to the employer to say in the light of the court s decision what do they intend to do? They are yet to respond to my letter he said. I want to keep him out of the spotlight. We haven t consulted and I am only seeing later today or tomorrow as I am in the high court for another matter. This judgment doesn t really disturb the status quo much added Majavu. The process of the appointment of a board is a parliamentary process. But I don t know what my client s instruction will be. Monday s ruling also declared that unless and until the negative findings against Motsoeneng in the public protector s 2014 report are reviewed and set aside or unless and until Motsoeneng is exonerated from the said negative findings by way of a valid disciplinary hearing Motsoeneng may not hold any position at all in the SABC.The public protector s report made various adverse findings about Motsoeneng including that he committed fraud by stating in his application form for employment that he had completed matric.Majavu speaking to SAfm on Tuesday morning said: There is nothing in court order that he is no longer an employee of the SABC.
