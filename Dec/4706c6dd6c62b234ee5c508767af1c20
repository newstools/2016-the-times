Speaking to Slikour recently, AKA revealed that he no longer had any bad feelings towards Black Coffee and even went to personally wish him well at a gig in Durban last month. I actually walked up to him the other day the Essence Festival in Durban was the first time I had seen him since that thing happened (the slapping incident). He was having a conversation with someone. I walked up to him, stood there and waited for him to finish his conversation. I greeted him: Yo, what s up? Have a good show and went to my dressing room. Things like that disables the tension, AKA explained.The One Time hitmaker said that he realised, that no good could come from his beef with Black Coffee. I thought to myself: I ve been down this road before and there was no positive outcome . I m trying to set up this company. I m trying to set myself up as a businessman and a father. It just didn t make sense anymore. Then I realised: Who am I trying to prove myself to? I have nothing to prove to anyone. I don t have to prove to Nathi (Black Coffee) that I m a tough guy, AKA said.The rapper added that he was in a better space and was now focused only on gains . I m no pushover but I didn t see any gains and I m only focused on gains, AKA said.And while AKA once had a long list of rivals he was beefing with, the rapper revealed that he got over the bullsh*t . I really don t have time for the bullsh*t. Even the ones I created, even the ones I engineered. I m even trying to disable my own bullsh*t, he said.
