First he wrote to Greater Giyani Municipality in Limpopo asking for results of the interviews it had held for the position of municipal manager as well as the competency assessments. When that failed he brought an application under the Promotion of Access to Information Act which the municipality ignored. So Masingi went to court and on Thursday a judge in the high court in Pretoria ordered the municipality to explain why he had not been appointed.
