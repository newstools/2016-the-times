The transfer window opens at the beginning of January and there are a host of players who need to switch clubs for game time.But for some players it provides an escape route. Whatever the reason some players crave playing time and want out.Assembled in no particular order TMG Digital looks at 10 PSL players who need to make a switch in January.As would be expected most of the names on the list come from the top flight s biggest clubs whose great wealth affords them the luxury of keeping legions of talent on the fringes of their first teams.KHAMA BILLIAT: MAMELODI SUNDOWNSThe reigning PSL Footballer of the Year is reportedly a target for Belgium Pro League sides Club Brugge and KV Oostende.There is no argument that the mercurial Zimbabwean international is a cut above the rest. A move to a higher level to test his abilities against some of the world s best might be timely this January.At 26 years of age he will become less attractive to European clubs the longer he stays in South Africa.SIPHELELE MTHEMBU: KAIZER CHIEFS That Mthembu was placed on the transfer list at the beginning of the season is enough to conclude the 29-year-old s future at Naturena is not filled with great hope.The striker found no takers before the close of the August window and subsequently somehow managed to negotiate his way back into contention.But he is yet to kick a ball so far this season or even make it onto the bench.SIYANDA XULU: KAIZER CHIEFSLike Mthembu Xulu was also put on the transfer list before being drafted back into the squad.It appears that while Steve Komphela remains in charge at Amakhosi there appears to be little future for the former Russia-based defender.The blossoming partnership between Lorenzo Gordinho and Mulomowandau Mathoho in Chiefs back line has seen Xulu grow increasingly marginalised.Xulu has played a handful of games since joining Chiefs. The 24-year-old risks spending the rest of the season in the reserves if he can t find a move.SAMUEL JULIES: MAMELODI SUNDOWNSThe 22-year-old midfielder or left-back has failed to crack it into the first team at star-studded Sundowns despite making his debut in 2012 and being sent out on a number of successful loan spells elsewhere.Julies would be a regular for many PSL teams if he managed to earn a move even if it were to be yet another loan agreement.MOTJEKA MADISHA: MAMELODI SUNDOWNSLike his teammate Julies the 21-year-old former Amajita captain needs yet another loan move elsewhere to accumulate some vital game time.Madisha has failed to break into Sundowns starting line-up since being promoted to the first team this season.He spent last season on loan to Highlands Park and was instrumental as the Lions of the North roared to the National First Division title last season.Another loan move or an outright move would be ideal for the defender born in Zebediela Limpopo.SIYABONGA MPONTSHANE: ORLANDO PIRATESWith Brighton Mhlongo and Jackson Mabokgwane currently being first and second-choice goalkeepers for Pirates as a goalkeeper at his age he is at his prime and needs to play regularly.The 30-year-old shot-stopper was linked with a move to Free State Stars and Highlands Park during the off-season but the former Platinum Stars man opted to stay on and compete for his place in this season s Bucs squad.He is yet to play with half of the season gone and with his level of experience a lot of PSL clubs would not hesitate to bring him on board.TERCIOUS MALEPE: ORLANDO PIRATESThe Under-23 South Africa international was recalled by Pirates from a loan spell with relegated NFD club Moroka Swallows last season.At just 19 the defender would not mind another loan move to earn game time.But with Pirates struggling at the back and still undecided on their regular back line should Malepe bite the bullet for this season and hope to crack a place in the first team next season?SIPHELELE NTSHANGASE: BLACK LEOPARDSOne of the NFD s shining stars of recent years the exciting attacking midfielder is a long time target of Chiefs.Despite playing in the second-tier of South African football Ntshangase played a part in both the Bafana Bafana set-up and the SA national U23 team before he was disrupted by a career-threatening injury.Leopards chairman David Thidiela is on record saying he is willing to listen to any offers that can meet the player s price tag.THOBANI MNCWANGO: POLOKWANE CITYIt s hard to see how Mncwango will ever regain his confidence after his heartbreaking failed move to Pirates in the off-season.The 28-year-old scored 13 league goals in 29 appearances last season and attracted a strong interest from the Buccaneers.By his own admission he was never the same player after the move failed to materialise.He has scored just three goals at the halfway mark this season and a move to Bucs to fulfill his dream could be just what his career and confidence needs.BONGANI NDULULA: CHIPPA UNITEDNdulula joined the Chili Boyz at the start of the season after an unsuccessful 2015-16 at Chiefs where he spent much of his time playing in the reserve Diski Challenge.The 26-year-old is yet to play any official games for Chippa in 2016-17. In August media reports were that the Port Elizabeth side have had issues with players fitness and his future was being discussed.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
