On Monday a blueprint for South African rugby which places the well-being and needs of the Springboks at the top of the agenda began to take shape after a second lower key coaches Indaba took place at SA Rugby s offices.The gathering featured all the Super Rugby coaches and Bok coach Allister Coetzee as well as Alexander and other role players.It was a follow-up to October s historic Indaba but more focused on operational outcomes rather than conceptual ideas which the first gathering mapped out.After the Springboks struggled to a 33 per cent winning ratio the bulk of South Africa s Super Rugby sides also toiled in 2016.There was also an acceleration of player defections to foreign clubs while player conditioning appears to gave gone backwards as well.Alexander s administration is tackling these issues head on by first changing the structure of the sports governance to gain greater control over players.Last week Alexander and chief executive Jurie Roux quietly heaved a sigh of relief after the General Council voted to change the organisation s constitution.In effect the Council voted to strip itself of far reaching powers in the game.It was ground-breaking because it was a major step to allowing the professional side of rugby to be governed more stealthily via a smaller Executive Council.By removing unions from making decisions that were often in the best interests of their constituencies rather than the Springboks SA Rugby will be able to control player welfare and development with more influence.On Monday progress on key issues such as player conditioning and skills development were mapped out and agreed to by Super Rugby s new breed of coaches. As a result of the excellent collaboration between our coaches at the Indaba we now have the guiding principles of a much needed blueprint for South African rugby Alexander said. Since the pioneering first meeting took place in October we have witnessed how our coaching conditioning and medical experts all come together in a fantastic show of unity to collaborate and plot ways to improve South African rugby. Exact details of what decisions were taken were not immediately available. The blueprint for SA Rugby is now at an advance stage and the decisions from today s meeting will be incorporated in a document which we will finalise early next year Coetzee said. We discussed certain skills sets and fundamentals which will ensure players meet the required Springbok standards. We also looked at the 2017 international calendar with the aim to optimise preparation time of the Springboks and presented the outcomes of the conditioning workshop held last week. Other discussion topics included player contracting player retention and succession planning.*SA Rugby also confirmed that France will play three Tests in SA for the first time since 1967 in June 2017. The Tests will take place at Loftus Versfeld King s Park and Ellis Park. - TMG Digital
