The agency held SA s foreign currency sovereign credit rating at BBB- the lowest investment-grade rating and kept its outlook negative.S&amp;P was the last of the big three agencies to make an announcement in this round of rating reviews and was the most important as it was the only agency that had SA s foreign currency rating one notch above junk with a negative outlook meaning it was the most likely to downgrade SA to junk.In the lead-up to the decision analysts were saying the decision on the foreign currency rating was too close to call. A week ago Fitch kept its BBB- rating on SA but changed its outlook from stable to negative. Moody s issued a research report instead of a rating decision in effect maintaining the rating at two notches above junk with a negative outlook without actually affirming it.But it issued a warning to SA to get its messy politics sorted out.Local currency rating Although the local currency rating was not the decision that had everyone one edge it is nonetheless significant because it covers the rand-denominated bonds that the government issues in the domestic market about a third of which are owned by foreign investors.Downgrades to this rating could affect capital flows to SA especially given that SA s domestic bonds are included in a key international bond index. But in S&amp;P s case the local rating is still in the investment grade tier.The decision on the foreign currency rating means SA has again narrowly escaped being relegated to the sub-investment grade zone after avoiding that danger six months ago and a year ago.A downgrade to junk is a potential catastrophe as it would oblige many fund managers to pull their funds. It can set off a downward spiral blocking much-needed investment and making it more expensive for the government to borrow money at a time when the fiscus is under pressure from lower revenue collection as a result of slow economic growth.It is possible but very difficult for a country to claw its way back from a junk rating.Only six of 20 countries cut to junk by S&amp;P over the past three decades have regained investment-grade ratings and that took them between 13 months and more than 11 years to achieve data compiled by Bloomberg show.Rand Merchant Bank research shows the typical recovery takes about 7.5 years.SA now has another chance to avoid having to do that.junkUntitled infographic Create line charts-Business LIVE
