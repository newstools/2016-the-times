Of those 14 defeats two came in the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan this month and a further five were on the road competing in continental competition. These included the 1-0 loss in the second leg of the Caf Champions League final in October at Borg el Arab Stadium in Alexandria, which was not enough to prevent victory on aggregate for Downs following their 3-0 first leg win at Lucas Moripe Stadium.There was also the 2-1 first leg semifinal defeat against Zesco United which Downs won 3-2 on aggregate and the 3-1 away defeat against Enyimba in Nigeria fielding a second-string outfit having already wrapped up progression through the group stage.Downs lost just seven times domestically including 3-0 in the MTN8 final against Bidvest Wits in early October and on penalties against SuperSport United in the Telkom Knockout semis in the midst of a gruelling schedule having recently been crowned African champions.They lost just five times in the PSL. One just needs to examine the list of award nominations Downs have received to confirm that theirs has been the best club side in Africa by a clear margin in 2016 and perhaps even the best seen in the PSL. Four players Khama Billiat Keagan Dolly Hlompo Kekana and Denis Onyango were shortlisted in the last five as nominees for Caf s local-based player of the year award.Two Billiat and Onyango made it to the last three. Billiat is the overwhelming favourite to win. Pitso Mosimane was nominated for Caf s coach of the year. This week the coach was included at 10th on the International Federation of Football History and Statistics prestigious list of top club coaches in the world and Onyango in the same position for goalkeepers. African champions the first from South Africa since Orlando Pirates in 1995 despite the distraction of domestic semifinals; PSL champions smashing their way to a new 71-point record despite the distraction of continental football.And the first southern African team to compete at the Club World Cup (CWC). The milestones have been reached and passed by like a runaway freight train. Sundowns success in 2016 was the culmination of three years of building a team by Mosimane capable of conquering Africa.The pre-season camps on the continent the multitude of quality signings from the wallet of billionaire owner Patrice Motsepe the failed fact-finding excursions into continental football all played their role.So too did the assembly of a technical team from prodigy assistant Rhulani Mokoena to the quiet presence of the experienced Manqoba Mngqithi to highly-rated fitness trainer Kabelo Rangoaga the collective modern wisdom of which has not been seen in SA football. All of which brought together into one, fantastic year, that Downs and Mosimane hope can even be improved upon in 2017.Not too much more can be said about Downs year that hasn t already been expressed. They played beautiful classic South African football that harkened to their famous combinations of the 1990s. They might even have been better. They certainly achieved more. Their small blemish was being found short on pace and quickness of thinking at the CWC by two Asian teams South Korea s Jeonduk Hyundai Motors (4-1) and Kashima Antlers of Japan (2-0) used to playing at that intensity in their domestic leagues. But Downs were not despondent and as they had from their first unsuccessful forays into Africa promised to learn and reinvent and be back stronger.Mosimane came of age in his defining year maturing into perhaps the first truly international class football manager South Africa has produced. Even he found out at the CWC that like any top coach he still has much to learn and that at the top things just get tougher. Overall though bravo Sundowns. They have alerted Africa that South African football is not a write-off.They have restored our faith after years of suffering and a slow erosion of belief and have given the supporters of the game in the country hope that there can be more success to come in the future.
