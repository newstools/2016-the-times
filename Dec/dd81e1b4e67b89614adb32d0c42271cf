It took Jenna Lewinsky, formerly of Durban, and her Israeli husband Gil three years of high-level negotiations between the Israeli and Canadian governments for the heritage sheep to be repatriated to Israel.The dappled goat-like sheep arrived in the Holy Land this week, where they have been extinct for nearly 200 years.Jacob sheep, with an ancestry that traces back 5000 years to the Middle East, appear in the book of Genesis in the Old Testament - they were given to Jacob by his father-in-law as wages - and their wool was used to make Joseph's famous multicoloured coat.The flock began arriving in Israel as Jews around the world read Parasha Vayetzei, which commemorates the origin of the Jacob sheep in Genesis.Lewinsky told the Times of Israel: "It was beautiful to see them walk on the soil of Israel. It was spectacular."The couple will stay with the sheep while in quarantine to guard them from theft and wolves, both prevalent problems for livestock in Israel.The Lewinskys started their flock with four sheep in British Columbia."We took it upon ourselves to save as many pure-bred Jacob sheep as we could," Jenna said.
