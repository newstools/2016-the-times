Food to military bases in Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Limpopo began running low from Sunday, with base commanders ordering troops to return home because they could not be fed properly.Soldiers apparently were forced to pay for their own transport home.While those who could afford to return home left, scores who could not were left starving.The SANDF revealed yesterday that a new electronic procurement system had resulted in certain food suppliers being unable to make their deliveries of food to several military bases.A soldier based in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, who cannot be named, said: "We were addressed by our section heads on Tuesday and told that there's a food crisis and that we need to go home."We were told that we had to return on Sunday."The soldier said he could not return home to KwaZulu-Natal because he had no money to travel.He said 60 of his colleagues, who lived close to the base, had managed to return home.The trooper said R1,100 was deducted from salaries for accommodation and food."We have never had such a situation where there has been no food in the base," he said.He also said the section head was unable to explain why there was no food."On Tuesday we received meals, but on Wednesday we did not get our normal breakfast of tea, bread and soft porridge. We had brunch but are still waiting for dinner."The Times has learnt that among the bases affected were Zeerust, Doornkop, Middelburg and Mafikeng.The food crisis appears for now to have been averted after a meeting was held yesterday between the SA National Defence Union and the SANDF.The meeting came after the union issued a letter of demand to the army on Tuesday instructing them to bring the troops back to base and supply them with food.Sandu secretary Pikkie Greeff said lawyers had been in negotiations to resolve the matter.He later tweeted: "The SANDF has just capitulate(d). Food has now been delivered to the affected bases. Soldiers are eating."In the letter of demand the union said the SANDF was obliged to provide the affected with "sufficient rations".Greeff said soldiers affected would "run into hundreds".He also criticised the government on Twitter: "While our President Zuma is on his way to attend Castro's funeral, his soldiers are going hungry. Would Fidel have been proud?"In another tweet, he criticised the SANDF's leadership, asking what kind of management "can't even see to it that their soldiers are properly stocked with food".SANDF spokesman Colonel Ronald Maseko said the army had experienced low levels of rations at three of its units.He said the affected bases were 2, 4 and 21 South African Infantry Battalions."The shortages at 2SAI and 4SAI were resolved. Currently, the situation at 21SAI is being addressed with the wet rations being brought to the required levels."Maseko said the shortage was a result of the introduction of National Treasury's new e-procure system."It is aimed at regulating the supply chain management in government. The new procurement system requires that all suppliers be centrally registered on National Treasury's database."This re-registration has led, in some instances, to some suppliers being unable to deliver or supply the SANDF as per tender contract regulations due to their details, as per new regulations, being incomplete on the system," he said.
