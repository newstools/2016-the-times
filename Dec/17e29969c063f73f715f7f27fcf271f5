He blasted down a question about the final after Tuesday s draw with Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium and has told his club s media department he doesn t want to speak about the game against SuperSport United until after Friday s match against Bidvest Wits. We ve still got the Wits game and then I ll deal with the final after that said Tinkler after a reporter asked him about City s chances in the final against Stuart Baxter s team. My players must understand we have a very important league game and we want to win it so that we keep up momentum going into the final. We can t afford to be thinking about the Telkom final just yet. City have won seven of their last eight games and sit top of the Absa Premiership standings. They have 21 points from 11 games one more than Wits who have played two games less which makes Friday s clash key for both clubs.After the Wits game City will return home on Saturday to begin preparations for the final which takes place next Saturday at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
