Presenter John Robbie on Thursday bid farewell to listeners on his last show on Radio 702 after 30 years unbroken at the station . Robbie said he hadn t still decided what he was going to do after hanging up his earphones but joked that he was looking forward to not getting up so early in the morning .He used his last daily Comment segment to declare: I am still pretty optimistic about SA. This was in contrast to 1986 when he joined 702 when the country faced great uncertainty . South Africa was basically involved in a civil war at the stage it was the last throw of the old South Africa PW Botha had refused to cross the Rubicon the townships were in flames Nelson Mandela was still in jail ANC and others were banned you couldn t mention them on the radio you couldn t mention ANC PAC Communist Party you couldn t mention them on the radio or talk to them he said.Moving forward 30 years Robbie said that despite the problems we have a thriving democracy things like the public protector things like the parliamentary inquiry into the SABC they show I believe that things are starting to work . He said the country would do a stock-take after President Jacob Zuma whom Robbie described as an unmitigated disaster finally leaves office. I believe in the country we have the potential to not just survive but to thrive. 702 announced Robbie s retirement from the airwaves last month. He is to be replaced by afternoon drive show host Xolani Gwala.Watch Robbie s final Comment here.
