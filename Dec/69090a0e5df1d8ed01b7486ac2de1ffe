The Presidency yesterday said that the police had told their lawyers to make offers of compensation to the families of the victims.Thirty-four Lonmin miners were killed by the police near Marikana platinum mine, in North West. Ten people had been killed in the days before. Lonmin risks losing its mining rights if it fails to implement agreements about employee housing, according to the Presidency.Presidency spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga said most of the quantified claims were for loss of support or unlawful arrest and detention.He said 81 claims for personal injury had been delayed by a lack of agreement among medical experts.Ngqulunga said a colonel, a warrant officer and a constable faced murder charges, and a major-general and a brigadier faced charges of defeating the ends of justice and attempted murder.He declined to name them but said the Independent Police Investigative Directorate had made the recommendation to prosecute."Forensic, ballistic and other evidence, including the authentication of incident footage, are outstanding. Indications are that the police might have tampered with the crime scene," said Ngqulunga.Judge Ian Farlam was appointed by Zuma to investigate the massacre. -TMG Digital
