The ride-hailing giant raised eyebrows recently when users learnt that the app will continue to track a fare's GPS signal up to five minutes after he's finished his trip, even if the app is no longer open."Uber will now collect your location data from the time of the trip request through to five minutes after the trip ends, including when the app is in the background," said Uber South Africa spokesman Samantha Allenberg.She said the reason was to "improve pick-ups, drop-offs, and customer service". Users still have the option to turn off location data at any time through device settings on their phone.The UK's Daily Telegraph reports that some Uber users are concerned about their privacy as a result of the new development."I will not use an app that requires me to share my location at all times. After 6 years I am switching from @Uber to @lyft #privacy", said user @gadishamia.But some users expressed satisfaction with the new configuration because they felt "safer".Dinuka Jayasuriya ?@dinukapj said: "This is not a bad thing. They use this to make sure you got there safely and not to another location."Allenberg maintained that privacy would not be compromised."We respect rider and driver privacy. We are rolling the collection to users and will ramp up over time," she said.Allenberg said the addition was a result of feedback on how to improve the Uber experience."This change allows us to make times of arrival more accurate, and identifies the best pick-up locations for riders, and more."Murray Hunter, spokesman for not-for-profit body Right2Know, said that although some users felt the new feature improved safety against "creepers", Uber, in this instance, was the creeper."We need to be worried about the information collected about us. Uber is the creeper."
