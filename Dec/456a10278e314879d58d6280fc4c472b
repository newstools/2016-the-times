"The fire has burnt mainly fynbos areas where there are no structures."A fire disaster area had been declared in order to access additional resources and the South African National Defence Force had been asked to provide firefighting helicopters."Heavy smoke is impeding visibility so that it is unclear what the head of the fire is doing " said Smith. "There is currently no indication of when the fire might be contained as it may take months to deal with suppression and mop-up."However with wind travelling at 50 km/h and only 10ml of rain expected today so the risk continues."Working on Fire teams across the country had been placed on standby and 70 firefighters from the Free State were expected to arrive today to assist.
