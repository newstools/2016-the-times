Plett Tourism spokesman Patty Butterworth said the man, in his early 50s and whose identity is known to TMG Digital, did not only fleece pupils attending the Plett Rage Student Festival - he allegedly scammed other holiday-makers looking to spend time in the popular coastal town.Victims paid for their accommodation only to discover, upon arrival, that nothing had been booked.Butterworth said there was confirmation of three holiday bookings, valued at about R300,000, made through bogus accommodation websites www.ethosholidays.co.za and www.aiea.co.za."This is so frustrating. I feel terrible for the people," said Butterworth, who added that the man had also targeted people in the UK.Plett Tourism estimates that about 100 pupils were scammed and on average each may have forked out R8000 to R12000. Butterworth said the man might have scammed enough people to make millions.Police spokesman Captain Malcolm Pojie said officers at Plettenberg Bay Police Station are investigating two cases of fraud against the man.However he anticipates that more complaints will arise. He, too, believes that the scam is not limited to matriculants."The suspect is known to us. He is still at large but we are on his trail," said Pojie.Lawyer Gerhard Jordaan confirmed that he had acted for the man in the past."He was a client of mine," said Jordaan, who added that he was trying to contact the man because he was involved in four pending civil matters.Plettenberg Bay residents and businesses have come to the rescue of stranded pupils, said Butterworth.Some offered free accommodation at their homes while other establishments offered discounted rates to the pupils. Tents were also set up at a camping site.The Plettenberg Bay community has also taken to Facebook to join the search for the man.
