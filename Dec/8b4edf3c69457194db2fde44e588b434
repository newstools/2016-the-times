Called to brief MPs on recent issues detailed in the media, Nhleko tried to avoid answering questions about the ongoing saga between himself and Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride, saying the stand-off was still "subject to parliamentary processes".He said he did not want to discuss the issue because "we wouldn't want to deal with it outside the directives of parliament... (as this would) border on unfair legal process".But DA MP Zak Mbhele said the meeting had been called "precisely to discuss, among other things, the issues around McBride".Nhleko said recent media reports that his alleged girlfriend had received R30-million in state funding and reports concerning acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phah-lane's multimillion-rand house were "attempts to tarnish the work we do".He said rumours were swirling that the Claasen board of inquiry into former commissioner Riah Piyega's fitness to hold office would soon be made public."Now if that report says she is not fit then it means that someone stands a chance to fill that position, so you will find people trying to discredit and rubbish certain things."Nhleko added "innuendo, mudslinging and jostling for position" surrounded the Piyega matter.He also said claims that Phahlane paid for his home from the proceeds of crime were "ludicrous"."How do you just look at a house and say you can't afford it on your salary?" the minister askedAsked by committee chairman Francois Beukman whether he had faith in Phahlane, Nhleko said: "Indeed I do."
