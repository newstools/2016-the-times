The evidence is contained in reports and articles by commissions of inquiry into cannabis from all over the world and has been presented before the High Court in Cape Town.The highly anticipated case was launched by pro-cannabis parties including the Dagga Party and activist Garreth Prince.On Tuesday state advocate Sipokazi Poswa-Lenotholi argued that this evidence was ''weak'' and said it was a waste of the court's time.Judges Dennis Davis Vincent Saldanha and Nolwazi Boqwana are presiding.However Garreth Prince one of the applicants said there was no legitimate reason why government should have criminal penal provisions in respect of the use of cannabis."Cannabis does not belong in the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act. This is an equality issue. Cannabis should be treated the same as alcohol and tobacco '' Prince told the court.The state wants the matter to be tabled before Parliament but Prince argued that the issue should not depend on a political process. He also told the court that dagga use should be legalised and distribution should be regulated by government.Prince a trained lawyer dagga activist and Rastafarian approached the Constitutional Court more than 10 years ago to argue it was his constitutional right to use cannabis.He also tried to have the Cape Law Society admit him as an attorney something it would not do because he had a conviction for dagga possession.In 2001 he told the Sunday Times that dagga is a ''sacrament within the Rastafarian movement''."We eat it we bath in it we bake with it we puff it from time to time '' said Prince.In 2013 Prince his wife and daughter appeared in court for cultivating and dealing in dagga.TMG Digital/Sunday Times
