Ajax were awarded a penalty with five minutes to go by referee Daniel Bennett and after Paulse saw his effort from 12-yards saved, was able to tap home the rebound to make it three wins in a row for the Urban Warriors.You will do well to find a poorer match this season though as neither side was able to find much attacking edge in a game littered by mistakes and a distinct lack of quality.The result means Golden Arrows drop to sixth position in the Premiership table, while Ajax move into 10th, four points ahead of Free State Stars in the relegation playoff position.Ajax kept the same starting XI that defeated Mamelodi Sundowns 2-0 in midweek, continuing with Erwin Isaacs in the right-back position, but found none of that spark and energy.Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen handed a first start since January to goalkeeper Nkosi Gumede in the absence of Maximillian Mbaeva, who suffered a concussion in their previous fixture.It took 18 minutes for the first real chance on goal, but Mark Mayambela s tame header was easy for Gumede in the visitors goal.Ajax went closer when Thabo Mosadi played a delightful ball behind the Golden Arrows defence for Prince Nxumalo, who turned his defender but could not beat the spread-eagled Gumede. Both coaches resisted the temptation of making a change at halftime, but the second half brought more of the same.Poor passing, a lack of penetration and at times a lack of ambition from both sides gave the match a frustrating feel. Ajax striker Paulse was the first substitute in the 72nd minute both coaches showing remarkable patience with their misfiring sides, as he came on sporting a face mask for his first minutes in over six weeks since suffering a fractured cheekbone.Paulse created a half-chance for Mosadi almost immediately but Gumede was able to save. Ajax then got a piece of luck when Siyabonga Dube was adjudged to have handled the ball in the penalty area and Bennett pointed to the spot.Paulse s spot-kick was tame, but Gumede could only parry it back into his path and the beanpole forward had the easiest of tap-ins to score.Next up for Ajax is a visit to fellow strugglers Highlands Park on December 14, while Golden Arrows host title-chasing BidVest Wits on the same night. - TMG Digital
