Municipality Festive Season Management Committee chairman Sbusiso Mkhwanazi said that beachgoers can help lifeguards and volunteers to ensure their and their children s safety. Be vigilant in ensuring that their children are kept within sight and are safe at all times as being separated can be a very traumatic experience for the children. Adhere to instructions given by lifeguards to ensure that everybody has a safe and enjoyable festive season. Beachgoers should only swim within designated bathing areas marked with red and yellow flagged beacons said Mkhwanazi. - TMG Digital/The Times
