Minnie caused a social media frenzy on Monday afternoon, when she shared a picture of her impressive bling, confirming her engagement. And of course rapper Cassper who is completely smitten with Minnie was left "devastated". Weighing-in on the situation, Somgaga took to social media to poke fun at the rapper and all men. In the hilarious video Somizi mockingly apologised to Cassper and pretends to cry. This will have you in stitches! A video posted by Somizi (@somizi) on Dec 12, 2016 at 7:00am PST
