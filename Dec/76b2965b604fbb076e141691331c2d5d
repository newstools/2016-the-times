The shared points left Gordon Igesund's Highlands struggling in 13th spot on the Absa Premiership log table on 13 points with half of their matches for the season played.Cavan Johnson's Stars remain in 12th position with 14 points from as many matches in what was the two clubs' maiden meeting in the top flight.Referee Khulekani Thusi had to be escorted through the tunnel by security personnel as the angry Highlands fans felt aggrieved by some of his decisions, which went against the home side.The Lions of the North roared to a two nil lead midway through the first half with goals in a space of three minutes from midfielder Mothobi Mvala and striker Carlton Mashumba.But the Highlands defence soon lost their heads as Dikwena found their way back into the match with two quick goals of their own - off the boots of Robert N'gambi and Benson Shilongo to steal a valuable point for Cavan Johnson's dim Stars.Following an opening 15 minutes which produced very little to write home about, Highlands spotted a weakness in Stars' defensive make up.The visitors from Rustenburg struggled to deal with the in-swinging corner kicks from the left foot of Franklin Cale.It came as no surprise in the 28th minute when Mvala rose above all and towered home a Cale corner kick to put the home side in front, 1-0.Mashumba made it 2-0 two minutes later after he also out jumped the Stars defence to powerfully head home from another in-swinging corner from Cale.But the two-goal cushion was short lived as N'gambi pulled one back for the visitors in the 33th minute with a thunderbolt volley from close range to reduce the deficit, 2-1.With seconds remaining before the half time break, a lapse of concentration crept into the Highlands defence.Namibian striker Shilongo received the ball on the edge of the Highlands box, beat his marker before firing past a hapless Tapuwa Kapini for the equaliser, 2-2.The goals dried out in the second half but credit must be given to Stars for the manner in which they fought back into the game.Stars should have snatched a late winner but were denied by the brilliance of Kapini, who made a slew of saves to frustrate the efforts of the visitors.- TMG Digital
