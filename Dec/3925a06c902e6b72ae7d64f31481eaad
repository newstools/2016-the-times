With about 16 000 baubles having to be placed on more than 100 Christmas trees, Thomas and Susanne Jeromin's annual winter wonderland at their house in Rinteln, Germany, has become a seasonal labour of love."We started off with a normal Christmas tree in the living room, as you'd expect, and then we thought we could put one in the hallway, one in the kitchen and, over the past five years, it's exploded," said Thomas.The couple began decorating their home in early October with lights, ornaments and decorations dotted throughout.Their bedroom is the only festive-free zone. "It's our retreat for when we've had enough of Christmas," Susanne said.
