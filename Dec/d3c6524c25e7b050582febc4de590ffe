The scoreline of Sundowns 2-0 defeat against Japanese host club Kashima Antlers in Sunday s quarterfinal in Osaka might not suggest Jeonbuk s opponents are a threat.But the Asian champions 57-year-old coach Choi said he took note of Downs first half where they dismantled Antlers and created half-a-dozen chances but could not score. In the first half they were entirely the better side and had a lot of scoring chances. But they were not able to score. Therefore in the second half they gave the chance to Antlers to come back the coach said on Thursday. Overall my assessment of Sundowns was that they have a lot of ability and a lot of skill. They play to a tempo and are well balanced and so good. Their forwards are very fast and quick. So we need to handle that. If we have a goal chance we need to take it. So we will also need to maintain our physical presence into the second half which was what we failed to do against Club America. That is why I will change the team and introduce young players so we have more mobility. Choi said Jeonbuk are set on winning their final official match of 2016. At the moment our players are very tired so it is a difficult situation for us but I am sure the players can have the professionalism to have a positive performance he said.The fifth-place playoff at Suita City Football Stadium is at 4.30pm Japanese time 9.30am in SA.* Marc Strydom is in Japan as a guest of Mamelodi SundownsTMG Digital/TMG Sport
