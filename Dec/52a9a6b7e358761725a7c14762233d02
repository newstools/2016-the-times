She was addressing members of the media at the Protea Hotel in Midrand on Tuesday where she was delivering a progress report on the state of the Festive Season Road Safety Campaign which was launched at Eldorado Park Soweto at the beginning of December."This is a big challenge that we have. In October there was a sting operation in Benoni by the Hawks where several of our officials at DLTC (Driving Learning Testing Centre) were arrested " said Peters."The anti-corruption unit has picked up the system that is being used by the corrupt officials where they literally take the licensing documentation from the back."In October the Hawks pounced on the six officials and arrested them in Benoni for selling driving and learner licences following investigations in the office since early this year.The six officials have since been suspended and were charged with fraud and corruption."We also [have] situations of actual corruption happening on the roads where traffic law enforcement officers are given bribes by motorists but also those who solicit bribes " added Peters.She said the establishment of the anti-corruption units and the involvement of the Hawks would aid in clamping down on corrupt officials.She also urged motorists not to offer bribes to officers but rather report them to the nearest police station using the official's name tag and registration number of the vehicle.With the festive season in its last 10 days Peters' department has noticed a high number of human factors which contribute to road fatalities these holidays."A very worrying human behavioral pattern that continues unabated is the tendency to ignore the call for road safety by road users " she said."We are witnessing an unprecedented pattern during this festive season which largely contributed to the unacceptably high levels of crashes and fatalities with human factors contributing 82%."The minister said those drivers who remain irresponsible and reckless on the country's roads have little regard for to other law abiding road users.
