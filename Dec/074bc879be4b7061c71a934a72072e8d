Comitis said he does not "interfere" with coach Eric Tinkler's job but occassioanly speaks to his players in a bid to motivate them."I don't interfere on the technical side and I let Tinkler do that. It is working well " said Comitis.The ex Ajax Cape Town boss has overseen City's meteoric ascendancy to the PSL summit much against pre-season predictions from amateur clairvouyants.Tinkler's charges have also reached the Telkom Knockout final and they will line up against Stuart Baxter's SuperSport United at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (6pm kickoff)."All the players need love and it doesn't matter who you are " Comitis said."You can be a superstar you got to be reminded that you are a great player and you got to be told when you perform that you are performing.Some of the players in the team are what you could have called "rejects" just a few months ago.A case in point is Robyn Johannes who prior to joining City had been released by lower tier side AmaZulu.Comitis said it is vital to keep reminding his players that they are good enough and that keeps them motivated."You can't be worried that they are going to ask for more money when you tell them they are playing well."You must praise them when it is time to praise."I do two things - great one-on-ones and I keep players motivated. That is my job " he said.On their good run Comitis praised the whole team including the technical side and hoped they would maintain their form."Give credit to all the players because everyone has stepped in and made their mark."Guys like Robyn Johannes who was forgotten and (Tshepo) Gumede didn't get much (game) time last year (at Pirates)."We are even starting to see the old (Lehlohonolo) Majoro " he added.Comitis confirmed that the players will share half of the Telkom Knockout prize money which is R4 million if they win the tournament tomorrow. - TMG Digital
