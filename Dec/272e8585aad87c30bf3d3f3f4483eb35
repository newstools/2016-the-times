Almost all those selected from the PSL are expected to make the final cut down to 23 though it is likely that at least one of the forwards chosen will be discarded.There was no space for the Kaizer Chiefs duo of Chirambadare and Katsvairo even on the provisional list though and they look unlikely to make the finals in Gabon that runs from January 14-February 5 barring a serious injury crisis among the forwards.The list does include defenders Blessing Moyo (Maritzburg United) and Onismor Bhasera (SuperSport United) midfielders Danny Phiri and Kudakwashe Mahachi (both Lamontville Golden Arrows) and Willard Katsande (Kaizer Chiefs) and forwards Khama Billiat (Mamelodi Sundowns) Cuthbert Malajila (Bidvest Wits) Evans Rusike (Maritzburg United) and Tendai Ndoro (Orlando Pirates).The biggest decision for Pasuwa will be around the strikers where he has an abundance of riches with Knowledge Musona and Nyasha Mushekwi almost certain to be selected.It means there could be no place for Malajila despite his vast experience and Rusike with Ndoro s weight of goals for Pirates moving him to the front of the pile.Former Chiefs striker Matthew Rusike who plays in Sweden is another option and along with Mushekwi scored in a recent win over Tanzania.There may be some more disappointed South African-based players outside of the Chiefs pair who are at this stage out of the mix not least in the goalkeeping department where George Chigova (Polokwane City) and Tapuwa Kapini may have hoped to force themselves into the reckoning.Highlands Park forward Charlton Mashumba is a budding talent but is up against too much in terms of ability and experience among the forwards.His teammate at Highlands defender Augustine Mbara and Ajax Cape Town fullback Eric Chipeta are others who are not being considered at this stage.Zimbabwe have been drawn in a tough Group B alongside Algeria Senegal and Tunisia at the finals. - TMG Digital
