Residents have heeded calls to reduce usage with the reduction in overall water use showing a drop from 905 million litres during the previous week to 870 million litres last week."We are thankful to those who are going out of their way to save water " the City s Mayoral Committee Member for Utility Services Ernest Sonnenberg said on Tuesday.He encouraged further savings saying: "In this age of convenience turning off the shower while soaping or collecting the rinse water from the dishes may seem tiresome. However once the period of adjustment is over I am certain that many families will start to wonder how they used to spend so much on water." Consumers are still not quite reaching the 800 million litre per day target that will ensure its dams remain at safe levels until the rainy season the city said."With dams levels now sitting at 51 2% our margin of safety continues to dwindle."
