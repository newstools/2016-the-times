An out-of-sorts City were humbled 4-0 at home by struggling Stars with the game coming just days after they won the Telkom Knockout trophy in Polokwane on Saturday.Comitis was livid that his request to have the fixture postponed to a later date given the arduous travel to and from Limpopo had been denied by the PSL.But the league says there is little room left on a congested fixture calendar this season that already sees the campaign stretching into June. To give context the 2016/17 season and fixture schedule is incredibly congested PSL spokesman Lux September told Times Media Digital. Every single club is aware of that knows that we are doing our level best to avoid changes and accepts the need for that. The success of Mamelodi Sundowns which we all celebrate has presented us with even more of a challenge. Before the League fixtures were firmed up they were circulated to all clubs for feedback."Each member has an opportunity to comment and many did in a fair and transparent process. The league has already warned that they may need to extend the season by up to three weeks as they try and get all the catch-up fixtures in. I am sure you are aware of the correspondence from the PSL Executive Committee and the circular in October 2016 dealing with all of this and setting out a very clear process to be followed when changes are requested. That is the process we follow which we applied here and there is no truth in the suggestion of Fair Play not being applied. - TMG Digital
