Lerato Manzini scored twice and Tshwarelo Bereng got the other as the home side turned around the half-time deficit to hand AmaKhosi a hammering and their coach a potential mortal blow.Komphela had to face a gauntlet f objects and abuse again fromn angry fans as hi exited the pitch. Siphiwe Tshabalala had Chiefs ahead after just 15 minutes but they were mostly passengers in the second half as Chippa ended their own slump in impressive fashion with their first win since September.Manzini, restoresd to the starting line-up, should have had a hat trick after missing a sitter in stoppage time but the game was in the bag by then.Diamond Thopola delivered the two crosses that saw Chippa scored twice in the space of two minutes. His cross in the 71st minute was headed home by Manzini and then he set up Bereng at the back post for the second within 60 seconds.The third goal was set up for Manzini by the unselfish Buyani Sali in the 86th minuteChippa came with a plan to dominate the midfield but when Strydom Wambi had to go off after just eight minutes with a hamstring pull, coach Dan Malesela had to change tactics and lost a little of the pressing that had Chiefs under early pressure.Malesela has also repeatedly bemoaned costly mistakes and there was again more reason for frustration when a back pass from Bongani Kama was turned into a goal in the 15th minute.Credit must go to Michelle Katsvairo for chasing down the back pass while Chippa s goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi was slow in coming out to clear it. He did get to the ball first but his clearance was weak and went straight to Tshabalala, who needed no second invitation to take the ball into the penalty area and tuck it away.Chippa skipper James Okwuosa had a chance to equalise from a Marc van Heerden corner after 27 minutes, emerging unmarked at the back post but put his header wide.Substitute Bereng fired a stinging shot goalwards some four minutes after that but Nhlanhla Khuzwayo, in the Chiefs goal for the injured Itumeleng Khune, parried the effort away.Chiefs had a penalty claim on the stroke of half-time when Willard Katsande went tumbling down in the Chippa area but referee Victor Hlungwani said he dived and handed him a caution for simulation , which means the Chiefs captain is suspended for Chiefs next game against Bloemfontein Celtic on December 14.Chippa were much after the break and began to wrestle back control but Chiefs should have provided themselves with a cushion of a second goal in the 65th minute when George Lebese had a chance at the back post but wasted a good effort. His lack of composure and slovenliness is an example of the malaise at Chiefs.After that it was the Chippa show with the quick turn around and they should have had more than just the three they scored in the final 20 minutes.Komphela, who now faces the sack, said simply afterwards: We must take this on the chin. - TMG Digital
