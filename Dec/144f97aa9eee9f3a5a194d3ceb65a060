The British rivals, who will go head-to-head in London on March4, had to be separated after spending 20 minutes trying to shout over each other.Former world heavyweight champion Haye, 36, who cut an aggressive figure throughout the conference, also insulted promoter Eddie Hearn and Bellew's trainer, David Coldwell.He and Bellew, the WBC cruiserweight champion who is stepping up to heavyweight for the first time, exchanged barbs before Bellew shoved Haye.Bellew accused Haye of struggling financially and spoke of the difficulties involved in negotiating with him."You could be fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world, but you're fighting me," said Bellew, 34."And you know why? For the money. You're skint."Haye fired back: "Let's see who's around your hospital bed on March 4. You're putting this guy in such a dangerous situation."Haye was involved in another press conference scrap when he tussled with Dereck Chisora in 2012.
