In a warning to drunk drivers, drinks company Diageo - which runs the Drive Dry campaign and was the brains behind the spine-chilling "Papa Wag vir Jou" award-winning advert - will launch a new short-film campaign next year.It "aims to shock motorists into thinking twice about getting behind the wheel drunk".The Drive Dry films will be shown during special events at schools to educate the young about the dangers of drinking.Between December 1 last year and January 11 road deaths increased by 14% to 1755, many of them as a direct consequence of alcohol abuse.Johannesburg metro police spokesman Superintendent Edna Mamonyane said 300 motorists were arrested in the city every weekend, most of them for drunken driving. She said the JMPD expected more arrests over the Christmas season."People want to go out and have fun and that is okay. But what I do not understand is why they still drive after drinking when there are services they could use."Mamonyane warned that the metro police would be out in full force and urged motorists to make alternative plans [to get home] if they drink.Tshwane metro police spokesman Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the police in the city would focus on vehicle roadworthiness and driver fitness.Siphesihle Dube, spokesman for the Western Cape transport and public works department, said the rules of the road would be strictly enforced and there would be a focus on drunken driving and speeding.WATCH: Diageo Drive Dry #ThisIsMyStory
