Top spot went to Julia Huysamer who said that she had not made any celebratory plans in advance just in case . I think we will probably go out for dinner said Huysamer who notched up nine distinctions including Advanced Programme Mathematics and Advanced Programme English and a 92% aggregate. I m glad my hard work paid off. Always an academic achiever Huysamer has never been a one-trick pony. She is a keen hockey and squash player as well as vice-captain of the athletics team. You need to strike a balance she said. Going to St Mary s was an amazing opportunity that I only received because both my parents are teachers. I was aware that very few people are lucky enough to be in my position so I had to make the most of it. The path to success is through prolonged effort and dedication. I started studying hard from the beginning of the year. It gives you a huge advantage as do prelims they are a test run and at St Mary s are as close as possible to finals. That helped me prepare. Huysamer s favourite subject at school was English and she is looking forward to studying towards a general BA with English at Wits next year. Because I have distinctions in Maths and Science people think I should be a doctor but I believe I should go with my gut and follow my heart and do something I love. TMG Digital/The Times
