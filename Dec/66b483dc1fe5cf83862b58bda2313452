Ever since Minnie announced her engagement on Monday, social media has been in a frenzy over the news. And while we may have to wait a little while longer to see a full picture of Minnie's bae, speculation has been rife over her man's identity for the past year. It's been rumoured for the longest time that Minnie has been romantically involved with her Urban Brew co-worker Quinton Jones. However, Minnie has never confirmed the rumours herself or shared a proper picture with her guy. But it seems like Minnie may just be stepping out of her shell. The star recently shared the most-loved up engagement snap of her and her bae that fans have ever seen. Even though Minnie has once again hidden her guy's face - fans believe it is Quinton.
