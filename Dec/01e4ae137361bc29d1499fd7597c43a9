The apologetic black waiter Mike Dzange appeared on television on Tuesday."I'd like to apologise deep from my heart for the trouble I have caused. It happened without intention of hurting anybody. I'd sincerely like to apologise to Mr Scott and partner Dzange a Zimbabwean national told eNCA.He said he should not have used a racial way of describing diners at the tables he waited.The waiter has since been suspended from The Bungalow in Cape Town where he has worked for eight years.Scott Magethuka who initiated the firestorm alongside his co-diner Sivuyile Madikana who was voted SA Medical Association s Junior Doctor of the Year last month tweeted the restaurant owners on Wednesday saying that in light of the public apology by Dzange he had decided to accept it.He said his intention had been to highlight that racial profiling was unacceptable. He hoped this was not repeated and that the waiter had learned from the experience."I also hope the internal procedures that are under way are fair and that Mike Dzange will not be at threat of dismissal as it would be very unfortunate especially at this time of the year."
