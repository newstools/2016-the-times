In a Day of Reconciliation message Maimane said that the public holiday marked a day that bound together South Africa s diverse and complex history. The Day of Reconciliation reminds us that the story of South Africa and her people has many often contradictory chapters that tell a story of where we have been and the great things we have yet to achieve together. Despite our different races cultures religions sexes and languages the common vein that runs through us all is that we are South Africans the DA leader said. While 2016 has seen a greater focus on our differences I do not think that it is a true reflection of South Africa and the work that has been done in building bridges over the last 22-years. There are more among us who continuously work to ensure that our country s motto of Unity in Diversity is not merely a phrase but a call to build a non-sexist non-racial and united country for all people Maimane added.He said the programme of reconciliation was reaffirmed during the August Local Government Elections when those who used our differences to mobilise without articulating a clear message of hope and change were rejected in favour of a message that brought us together .Reminding South Africans of the Constitution which called upon them to Heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic values social justice and fundamental human rights he urged the nation to recommit itself to building unity for a better South Africa.
