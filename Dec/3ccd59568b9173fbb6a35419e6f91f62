For one of the most sought-after players in the game, that approach could be key to extending his time in a South Africa shirt.Steyn, who broke the same shoulder for the second time in a year during South Africa's tour to Australia early last month, is in recovery from an operation a month ago in which the joint was repaired and strengthened with a pin.At the time of the surgery South African team manager Mohammed Moosajee, who is also the side's doctor, said Steyn should "expect a minimum six-month rehabilitation period before he can start any form of bowling".But the fast bowler is hopeful of a less bleak prognosis. "They say the first two to three months is just the healing phase, but by the end of February I'll be able to do things like light bowling and start swimming," Steyn said.At present, his options for physical activity are limited."I'm supposed to be doing spinning, but I find it so boring," he said."But in less than two weeks I can start running."Not that Steyn is complaining too much."It's actually really cool," he said. "I haven't had a long break like this in a good few years. Every season I go in with something wrong. And we hide them well. We're all cricketers, everyone's playing with something."It will be nice to go into a season, starting in June or whatever, knowing that I'm strong and in a good place."Steyn might be back for the Champions Trophy in England for the first match there on June 3 - and for South Africa's Test and T20 rubbers . - TMG Digital
