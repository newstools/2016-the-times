That January post went viral causing widespread outrage and leading to two court proceedings against her.The 68-year-old retired estate agent had in June been ordered by the Umzinto Equality Court to pay R150 000 to the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation after being found guilty of hate speech.Magistrate Irfaan Khalil said the amount had to be paid within 60 days and he interdicted Sparrow from further hate speech.The foundation however said on Thursday that it has not received payment from Sparrow.In September Sparrow appeared before magistrate Vincent Hlatshwayo in the Scottburgh Magistrates court on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast where she pleaded guilty to a charge of crimen injuria.She was fined R5000 or 12 months imprisonment in addition to two years imprisonment suspended for five years on condition she does not commit a similar offence and had to tender a public and Facebook apology for her offending post. She has not paid the fine said Department of Justice and Correctional Services spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga. She has applied for condonation and for leave to appeal. She has however written a letter of apology in terms of the court order. In her apology read in court a tearful Sparrow had said: I wish to make a public apology for my thoughtless behaviour. I have hurt the feelings of my fellow South Africans. I realise that what I have done is wrong. I am very sorry. TMG Digital
