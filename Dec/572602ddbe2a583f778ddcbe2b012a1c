The Blitzboks claimed the first leg of the 2016/17 HSBC World Sevens Series with an emphatic 26-14 victory over Olympic champions Fiji in the Cup final.With round two of the series in Cape Town to come next weekend, the Blitzboks have given their home tournament a huge boost.Although tickets for Cape Town were already sold out, SA s win in Dubai will further bolster the growing profile of the truncated version of the game, especially when taken against the fifteens Springboks dismal results in 2016.Victory in Dubai was the culmination of a dominant weekend of performances by SA that started with a 46-0 Pool B win over Uganda on Friday and included a record 40-0 win over New Zealand in the quarterfinals.After one round SA top the standings on 22 points, Fiji are second with 19, bronze medallists England have 17 and fourth-placed Wales 15.Flying wing Seabelo Senatla contributed 11 tries in the six matches to earn the Player of the Tournament award while forward Chris Dry won the man-of-the-match prize in the final.Senatla has now scored 168 World Series tries in only 150 matches, and is only 11 shy of the SA record of 179 held by the retired Fabian Juries.While Senatla rightly deserved the plaudits for his lethal finishing, it was the Blitzboks superb defensive and breakdown work that ultimately proved decisive during the knockout stages on day two.Against New Zealand Neil Powell s men regularly turned over ball in contact situations that allowed them to catch the 12-time series winners on the hop.Kyle Brown, Kwagga Smith, Dry and Branco du Preez were particularly lethal in that aspect of the game while Cecil Afrika and Justin Geduld provided the playmaking vision from turnovers.After topping their Pool, which also included wins over Scotland (21-5) and the USA (19-17) the Blitzboks were handed the tough assignment of facing NZ in the last eight. But they clinically brushed their old foes aside.They faced surprise package Wales in the semi-finals and were again dominant at the contact points as they ran in six tries to win 36-5. Senatla scored a first half hattrick. Victory set up a dream final against the reigning champions and Olympic gold medallists.Afrika scored almost from the kick-off in the final to immediately put Fiji on the back foot and they doubled that lead in the fourth minute when Du Preez scampered over after a sublime Senatla offload.From then on the islanders were forced to play catch-up rugby and although they levelled the scored early in the second half after tries from Osea Kolinisau and Jerry Tuwai the Blitzboks retained their composure.Senatla benefitted from a turnover minutes later to screech into the corner for try number three to re-establish SA s lead.Dry secured the title when he showed good pace score down the right hand touchline after Fiji coughed the ball up again.Final Scorers:South AfricaTries: Cecil Afrika, Branco du Preez, Chris Dry, Seabelo Senatla.
