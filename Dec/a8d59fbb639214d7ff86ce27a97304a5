The Buccaneers were held to a lively 2-2 draw at home to bottom club and newly promoted Highlands Park at Orlando Stadium on Saturday evening. Augusto Palacios' side twice squandered their lead to settle for a point in their first ever Premier Soccer League match between the two sides.It is yet another two points dropped for the Buccaneers following their midweek 1-1 draw with another newly promoted side, Baroka FC, in Polokwane on Tuesday.Pirates could have finished this match as the new table toppers had it not been for the consecutive draws. Instead, they dislodge Kaizer Chiefs in fifth place, who dropped a place down to sixth after they were humiliated 3-1 at Chippa United in the earlier match in Port Elizabeth.Bucs are now in 5th position with 18 points from 11 matches while the Lions of the North remained rooted at the bottom of the log standings with a mere seven points from 11 matches.Tendai Ndoro, the league's leading marksman, scored two goals in each half to register his 11th goal of the season four goals ahead of his nearest rival for the Golden Boot Award.The Zimbabwean goal ace put Pirates ahead as early as the second minute as he headed home a delightful Luvuyo Memela cross from the left, 1-0.Highlands did manage to equalise on the stroke of half time when Justice Chabalala brought down Edwin Sitayitayi in the box and referee Lwandile Mfiki pointed to the penalty spot.Midfielder Thanduyise Khuboni stepped up and sent Brighton Mhlongo the wrong way to make it 1-1.But Ndoro was not done for the evening as he won a Pirates a penalty 10 minutes into the second half. Ndoro converted the spot kick to bag his 11th goal of the season.The Lions of the North roared back in emphatic fashion as substitute Lindokuhle Mbatha's thunderbolt beat keeper Brighton Mhlongo hands down with 10 mintes remaining. The early goal gave the Buccaneers an instant boost in their confidence as they bossed ball possession with wingers Memela, Thabo Rakhale the chief tormentors while striker Thabiso Kutumela made some clever runs off the ball to distract the Highlands defence. Highlands Park gave as good they got but are still in search of their first league win under Gordon Igesund, and just a second of the season.The first half was littered with goal scoring opportunities for both sides and not so much in the second. Highlands, who were thumped 5-0 at Mamelodi Sundowns in their last encounter, have gone nine league matches without a win.The draw, their fifth in 10 matches so far, leaves Igesund's side still rooted at the bottom of the log with 8 points. Free State Stars, who were thumped 4-1 by Mamelodi Sundowns in the 3pm kickoff, are second from bottom with the same number of points. - TMG Digital
