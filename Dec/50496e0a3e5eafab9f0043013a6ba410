That is what happened in certain areas southern Johannesburg last week when six people armed with faked Pikitup IDs and letterheads were arrested by police for fraudulently asking for Christmas gifts from residents the company said on Tuesday. Four Pikitup employees were also nabbed. Workers are consistently being told and reminded to refrain from asking Christmas donations from residents. The implicated workers will be subjected to internal disciplinary action as a result said Pikitup acting chief operations officer Mzu Tshem.Two men dressed in Pikitup uniforms were arrested in Mondeor after a member of the area s Community Policing Forum questioned them about their presence in the area. One of the two men had a fictitious Pikitup ID and a forged company letterhead granting them permission to ask for donations from residents.In the Glenvista and Bassonia area four men who also pretended to the Pikitup employees were taken into custody.In Glenanda a Pikitup employee stationed at the Selby depot was arrested in the act of asking for Christmas donations while a further three Pikitup employees were arrested in Mulbarton.All the arrests were made last week. Pikitup appeals to Johannesburg residents to report such incidents to their Community Policing Forums and the police as the organisation does not permit its employees to solicit Christmas donations from residents. This culture as indicated by the recent incidents offers criminal elements to defraud residents of their hard earned money the company said in a statement. TMG Digital
