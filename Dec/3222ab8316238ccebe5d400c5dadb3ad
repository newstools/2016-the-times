The suspects aged 21 28 and 31 appeared in the KwaDukuza Magistrate's Court. They will remain behind bars until the case is heard again on December 28."The prosecutor revealed that several charges are being formulated against the three including assault; intimidation as well as malicious damage to property " the KZN health department said in a statement.It is alleged that on December 14 two health workers were assaulted and government property was damaged when people accompanying a patient to KwaDukuza Clinic turned violent."These people are suspected of being part of the crowd who had been attending a Christmas year-end party where alcohol was served in the Municipal Park adjacent to the clinic " the department said. "They are said to have got involved in an argument with the clinic staff which soon degenerated into attack against health workers. When security tried to intervene the attackers were joined by more revellers from the party."The clinic's security gate was ripped off its hinges and destroyed. "Fortunately security was reinforced by the personnel that happened to pass by as well as the police who were summoned to the scene. The three suspects who were seen to have led the attack were... arrested." Dhlomo slammed the attack. "Even during the days that we were fighting apartheid nurses and ambulances were never attacked. Instead they would be given safe passage and protected to attend to those shot by the enemy. The MEC said in many other countries attacks on health workers and government property were regarded as acts of sabotage. "We are really pleased that the magistrate in this matter has agreed with the prosecutor to keep the suspects behind bars until December 28. We hope they will utilize this gloomy time for introspection and eventually change their callous ways."- TMG Digital
