BusinessLIVE reports the affidavit is in support of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s application for a declaratory order from the court confirming that he does not have the authority to intervene in relationships between banks and their clients.Standard Bank which is also named as a respondent has gone further than Gordhan s application requesting the court to confirm that no member of the executive and not just the finance minister may interfere in banking relationships.The affidavit by group counsel Ian Sinton filed on Wednesday also reveals that Standard Bank was asked to meet both the African National Congress as well as the Cabinet inter-ministerial committee in an attempt to place it under political pressure to reverse its decision.The arguments advanced in both meetings as well as in a third meeting with former Oakbay CEO Nazeem Howa were substantially the same .The meeting with the ANC which took place at Luthuli House on April 21 included ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe his deputy Jessie Duarte and the head of the ANC s economic transformation committee Enoch Godongwana.In the meeting Standard Bank CEO Sim Tshabalala was asked to respond to the accusation that it was colluding with monopoly capital to oppress a black-owned business .On May 5 Tshabalala meet with members of the Cabinet inter-ministerial committee which had been tasked to meet the banks to discuss the Gupta accounts.Present at this meeting were Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant and Mzwanele Manyi who stated that he was attending in his capacity as a ministerial adviser .
