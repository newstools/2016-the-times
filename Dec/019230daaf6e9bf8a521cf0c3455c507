Fundraising group Feet for Fees says the book is at the heart of its efforts.Project initiator and manager Reuben Oosthuysen, a student at Wits University, said: "Nelson Mandela was passionate about education . and he had his own walk, and that's what sparked the idea and why we're walking to Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University - it's symbolic."The group of 15 students, most of them from Wits and the University of Johannesburg, began their trek on December 1.By yesterday they had walked about 720km.Today they began walking at 5.30am from Steynsburg, in Eastern Cape."We have two goals. The first being to raise R1,000 per kilometre that we walk and the second to get new annual bursaries donated by having companies approach us," said Oosthuysen."We want to donate the bursaries to NGO Study Trust, which will give them to those who need them."So far the students have raised R8-million in donated bursaries and just under R250,000 in individual donations.Asked about problems along the route, Oosthuysen said: "Water management: after a while your water is as hot as coffee. And money . We only have so much for food , and footware, sunscreen and navigation."The group is expected to reach Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University on Monday.
