With London's reluctance to outline its Brexit plan already irritating some European leaders, "BoJo's" blunders have only helped fuel the fire.There was the interview in Czech newspaper Hospodarske Noviny, where he said it was "bollocks" to claim that freedom of movement of people was one of the founding principles of the European Union.Then there was the "Prosecco" affair, where Johnson told Italy's economic development minister that the country should support Britain's access to the European single market if it wants to keep selling its bubbly.There was also the episode in September where Johnson told the Turkish president that he supported Ankara's EU candidacy, despite having warned during the Brexit campaign of an influx of Turks to the UK if Britain remained in Europe.Further afield, the former London mayor has also caused trouble. In his latest faux-pas, at a conference in Rome last week, he accused close ally Saudi Arabia of engaging in "proxy wars". A video of his comments was posted on the Guardian website.It was unfortunate timing for prime minister May, returning from a visit to Bahrain where she assured the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) of her support against terrorism and an "aggressive" Iran.Downing Street immediately pulled its foreign minister back into line, insisting that his comments reflected his "personal position" and not those of the government.While humiliating for Johnson - who is due to visit Saudi Arabia on Sunday -- the latest gaffe does not appear to have been career-shattering, with May preferring for now to have him in her government rather than out.By doing so, say analysts, she can appease the hardline Brexiteers within her Conservative Party, of whom Johnson is one of the leaders. Plus she can better control the loose cannon who had hoped to be prime minister in her stead.Others are less forgiving of the undiplomatic diplomat."The rest of the world are entitled to know that when Boris Johnson, as Britain's foreign secretary, speaks, they are hearing the United Kingdom's foreign policy," former Conservative foreign minister Malcolm Rifkind told BBC radio on Friday.Brian Klaas, a politics researcher at the London School of Economics (LSE), said even if Johnson is right about Saudi Arabia, "the problem is... he's not saying what Theresa May wants him to say"."But it's not much of a surprise; nobody really expected Boris to be the most diplomatic diplomat," he told AFP.Johnson's appointment in July to the high-profile post was met with astonishment at home and abroad.Could the blustering 52-year-old with his mop of dishevelled blond hair, who likes to please a crowd and frequently hits the headlines, quit the provocations and behave himself for this serious role?The qualities that kept him as mayor of London for eight years will not suffice for his new responsibilities on the global stage, warned Rifkind."As a foreign secretary you can't be a celebrity," he said, adding: "He might end up being more comfortable in another senior cabinet position."During a prize-giving ceremony for the Spectator magazine, May quipped that she would get rid of Johnson when she no longer needed him, in a darkly humorous reference to the killing of a dog."Boris, the dog was put down... when its master decided it wasn't needed any more," she told Johnson at the ceremony after he compared himself to a dog said to have been strangled by another top Conservative.As Rifkind put it, the "jury's out" on Johnson's future as Britain's top diplomat.- AFP
