The South African Football Association s disciplinary committee hearing was set to be heard from Thursday with an outcome expected next week.But at Mashaba s request the hearing originally postponed from last week was held back again said Safa communications head Dominic Chimhavi. The coach requested the postponement. He said he needed more time to gather his defence Chimhavi said on Thursday afternoon. The coach arrived [for the hearing] with his legal team and they said they wanted a postponement to organise their defence further. Mashaba was suspended from his position as head coach after a rant directed at his Safa bosses including president Danny Jordaan following Bafana s 2-1 World Cup qualifying victory against Senegal at Peter Mokaba Stadium on November 12. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
