SuperSport won the tournament for the first time in 2014 under Gordon Igesund while City will be participating in their first ever final.TMG Digital looks at five SuperSport key individuals who could influence the outcome of Saturday's Telkom Knockout Final at Peter Mokaba Stadium. Kickoff is at 6pm.Five reasons why Supersport United will win the Telkom TKO1) Stuart BaxterYou would expect the crafty Baxter to come up with a master plan to get past Eric Tinkler s high-flying City Boyz.Baxter will be driven by a personal ambition to become only the second coach in South Africa to win every domestic trophy on offer.The Telkom Knockout Cup is the only silverware missing from the Briton s CV.Baxter won the league twice as Chiefs coach from 2012 to 2015 plus the Nedbank Cup and MTN8.2) Ronwen WilliamsThe 24-year-old goalkeeper has grown in leaps and bounds under the guidance of Baxter.SuperSport will look to Williams to keep them in the game against a City side that has been free scoring in the past few months.City are comfortably the leading scorers in this year s competition with 10 goals in their three matches to date.3) The Reneilwe Letsholonyane factorLetsholonyane has established himself as the backbone of the SuperSport midfield since joining from Kaizer Chiefs in the off-season.The 33-year-old is no stranger to Cup finals.He won seven trophies with Chiefs including two league titles both under Stuart Baxter.His experience playing in Cup finals will surely come in handy in his first chance to grab a gold medal for SuperSport.4) Thabo MnyamaneMnyamane is SuperSport s leading scorer so far this season with five goals including four in his last five games.He has already found the back of the net against giants Orlando Pirates Kaizer Chiefs and Bidvest Wits and will aim to continue his scoring form in a Cup final.5) Morgan GouldThe 33-year-old Gould has looked rejuvenated since returning to Matsatsantsa from Kaizer Chiefs in the off season.Like his former Chiefs teammate Letsholonyane the former Bafana Bafana centre back has got a wealth of experience playing in Cup finals.Gould will need to marshal the SuperSport defence with aplomb if Baxter s team is to stop the free scoring City Boyz.- TMG Digital
