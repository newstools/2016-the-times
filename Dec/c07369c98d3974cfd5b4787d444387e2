Faf du Plessis won the toss and chose to bat and South Africa were 92 without loss at lunch on the opening day of the series against Sri Lanka.Cook was 52 not out with Elgar on 39 in their first half-century stand as South Africa s opening pair.The partnership was the biggest for South Africa s first wicket in the 15 tests played at St George s Park since Andrew Hudson and Kepler Wessels shared 98 against India in December 1992 the country s fourth test after readmission.Cook and Elgar were rarely tested by a Sri Lankan pace attack that quickly settled on a decent line and length and found movement off the seam but didn t have the pace to threaten the batsmen consistently.The closest Sri Lanka came to separating South Africa s openers was with the last ball of the 17th over when the edge that Nuwan Pradeep garnered from Elgar fell short of the slip cordon.Sri Lanka s key bowler Rangana Herath was introduced in the 20th over some 35 minutes before lunch.The slow left-armer has already extracted some awkwardness from Cook and Elgar but so far has not come close to making the breakthrough.TMG Digital/TMG Sport
