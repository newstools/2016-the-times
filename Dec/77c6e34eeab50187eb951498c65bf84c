Sundowns travelling fans may have had their trips paid for by the club s president Patrice Motsepe but they have shown impressive dedication enduring an 11 000km flight to Dubai eight-hour layover their then 11 000km more to Osaka in Japan.They kept the friendly grins on their faces despite the disappointment of Downs 2-0 quarterfinal defeat against host club Kashima Antlers on Sunday and were proud that their team played their brand of beautiful football on a global stage even if they could not score.But Dolly said Sundowns players are motivated to give their fans more to smile about before their equally arduous trip home on Thursday when the Brazilians meet Asian champions Jeonduk Hyundai Motors in Wednesday s fifth-place playoff (9.30am SA time). We were a disappointed with the result against Kashima. We knew we had let ourselves down and also the few of our fans who came out to support us from South Africa the left winger said. But it was a very long trip for us and our supporters and we don't want to go back to South Africa knowing that we didn't win and didn't give them something for having come out here. So for us it s about going out there and trying to win at all cost.
