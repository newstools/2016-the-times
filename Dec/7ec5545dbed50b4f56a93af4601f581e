Mpengesi has seemingly had a massive change of heart as he indicated a few days ago that he intended to appeal to the South African Football Association (Safa) after the Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) ruled in the player s favour last month.Malongoane had claimed that his contract with the Chilli Boys ended last season and he was free to leave the Eastern Cape club.But United steadfastly maintained that the 28-year-old could not join Chiefs on the free as he still had two years left on his contract."Molangoane signed a two-year contract with Chippa United towards the end of last season Mpengesi said in a statement issued on Friday afternoon."We were surprised that the player took us to DRC claiming not to have a contract with us. However twice he failed to convince the PSL that the signature on the document was not his. The matter went on and on the third sitting could not sit on a technicality (and) the player won the case."Chiefs announced the speedy skilful player s signing on a two-and-a-half year contract on the club s Twitter account last week.He made his debut for Chiefs against Chippa United last weekend but it seemed his nightmare was far from over when Mpengesi signalled his intention to lodge an appeal to Safa.But Mpengesi surprisingly dropped the matter on Friday and wished his former player who has also played for Orlando Pirates and Platinum Stars well."We have now taken a decision as Chippa United not to pursue the matter after hinting on our intention to appeal. (We will) allow the player to continue with his career at his chosen club (Chiefs) " Mpengesi said."We have over the years enjoyed a professional relationship with Kaizer Chiefs and based on this we do not feel the three parties (Chippa United Kaizer Chiefs and Joseph Malongoane) including the League will benefit if we proceed with the matter."I would then like to take this opportunity to wish Mr Malongoane all the best at Kaizer Chiefs. We thank him for the contribution he has made at Chippa United." Mpengesi s decision to let the matter rest brings to an end a protracted standoff that could have had a negative effect on the player s career.Molangoane trained with Chiefs during the off-season and was on the verge of putting pen to paper to complete a move to the Naturena side but a deal seemed to have fallen through as Chippa contested they still had a contract with him. - TMG Digital
