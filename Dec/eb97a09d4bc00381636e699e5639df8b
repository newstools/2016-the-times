"The Office of the ANC Chief Whip is gravely dismayed and shocked by the disrespectful and contemptuous conduct of SABC representatives today during the meeting of the parliamentary ad hoc committee probing the SABC Board s fitness to hold office " the office of the Chief Whip said."The representatives led by the only remaining board member and chairman Prof Mbulaheni Maguvhe staged a walkout in the middle of the ad hoc committee meeting after Prof Maguvhe s demand for all documents to be converted to brail was rejected as another stalling tactic."The utter disrespect that the SABC chairman and his lackeys continue to demonstrate against Parliament including the very institution they lead represents a serious attack against these public institutions and the people of South Africa " the office said in statement.The ruling party accused the SABC of stalling tactics aimed at frustrating the work of the ad hoc committee saying the committee was already behind schedule due to Maguvhe s court interdict which was rejected by the Western Cape High Court on Friday.A day before the inquiry was set to resume into the SABC board's fitness to hold office Maghuve launched an urgent application to interdict MPs from going ahead with the inquiry.
