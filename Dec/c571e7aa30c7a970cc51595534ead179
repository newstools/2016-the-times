AmaZulu forward Menzi Ndwandwe netted the winner two minutes from time after an afternoon of frustration for coach Thabo Senong s team who came up against a much more resolute side than in their opening 8-0 victory over Lesotho on Wednesday.Skipper Tercious Malepe went close but saw his header cleared off the line while the lively Luther Singh also forced a fine save from Swaziland goalkeeper Mlamuli Lukhele.After Platinum Stars midfielder Kobamelo Kodisang had struck the crossbar it looked as though the goal would not come until Ndwandwe drilled the ball home in the closing minutes.South Africa will book their place in the semifinals if Botswana do not beat Lesotho on Saturday.If they do Amajita will need just a draw in their final clash against the Young Zebras on Monday to make sure of their Last 4 spot. - TMG Digital
