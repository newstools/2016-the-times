The officers from KwaDabeka had teamed up with members of the Durban K9 Unit to respond to a vehicle theft in nearby Clermont. While they were pulling over the suspected stolen vehicle they were attacked by heavily-armed occupants of a second car. "Another white motor vehicle with unknown occupants showed up and the occupants opened fire on police. Two police officials sustained gunshot wounds and were taken to hospital for medical attention. The suspects left their vehicle and fled the scene as police retaliated " SAPS spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said. It appeared that the vehicle had been hijacked on Friday presumably for use in other crimes. "An AK47 rifle with 25 rounds of ammunition was also found in the vehicle " said Naicker. Acting police commissioner Major General Bheki Langa vowed to crack down on criminals who target cops. "We will not take attacks on police officers in the province lightly. Police officials are putting their lives on the line to protect the citizens of this country as well as their property. We will do everything that is within our control to ensure that those responsible for this latest attack are put behind bars where they belong. We wish both police officers a speedy recovery " he said. Monday morning's incident comes just a week after Constable Sabelo Nikwe died after being shot in the stomach while chasing after a suspect in Ntuzuma north of Durban. He was just 25 years old. - TMG Digital/The Times
