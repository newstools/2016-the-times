The 32-year-old St Lucia all-rounder has not played for the West Indies since captaining the team to a dramatic last-over victory against England in the World Twenty20 final in Kolkata in April. Afterwards, Sammy used the presentation ceremony to say how his side felt "disrespected" by the West Indies Cricket Board's lack of support. Sammy was speaking just two days after the West Indies suffered a crushing 133-run second Test defeat by Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates. That left them 2-0 down in the three-match series and was their 19th loss in 29 Tests.
