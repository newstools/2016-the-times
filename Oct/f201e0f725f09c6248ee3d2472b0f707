While Gold was hamstrung by inheriting a jaded squad from former Springbok coach Jake White, they bumbled and underperformed last year but showed signs of improvement this year when they made the Super rugby quarterfinals.However, his term was punctuated by the Sharks not being able to make the Currie Cup semifinals in the past two seasons (last year under his direct tutelage) and inability to play attractive rugby.There were signs of life with a younger squad this year that was developing an all-round brand of rugby even though it was based on abrasive defence.However, the fact he won nothing in his two years will mark his forgettable tenure.He will be replaced by Robert du Preez, who breathed new life into the Sharks' Currie Cup unit despite the team not making the play-offs."I have had an unbelievably enjoyable two years in Durban, with many highs and a few lows."There is an exciting group of youngsters who are currently in the system, who have great futures ahead of them," Gold said.Meanwhile, prop Lourens Adriaanse and flanker Nizaam Carr have replaced unavailable Jannie du Plessis and injured Jaco Kriel in the South Africa Test squad for a November tour of Europe.Loose-forward Kriel tore knee ligaments playing in Japan and will be out of action for up to eight weeks.France-based tighthead Du Plessis wants to be with his wife, who is expecting their third child soon.
