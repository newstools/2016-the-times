The party said the wasteful spending was revealed in a reply to a DA parliamentary question which shows that the following amounts were spent on civil litigation and internal disciplinary proceedings against the following individuals: This speaks directly to the politicisation of our law enforcement agencies and the resultant perversion of our criminal justice system DA shadow minister of police Zakhele Mbhele said in a statement.He said the state had lost more than five times in trying to get rid of Booysen on baseless claims.In September this year the Constitutional Court ruled that the Minister of Police Nathi Nhleko acted outside his authority when he unilaterally suspended Robert McBride without any due consultation with Parliament.Mbhele said in January 2014 the high court in Pretoria slated the illegitimately installed head of the Hawks Gen Berning Ntlemeza citing his suspension of Sibiya then Gauteng Hawks boss as unlawful invalid and unconstitutional.Both the high court in Pretoria and the Constitutional Court declared that the Police Minister s decision to suspend Dramat was unlawful invalid and must be set aside . With each day it becomes more and more apparent that the Hawks under the compromised Berning Ntlemeza and at the behest of Nhleko is being used to settle political scores and to intimidate those who would speak truth to corruption among those in power. He said the money spent on frivolous litigation should rather be spent on improving the performance of the police service through better equipping the hard-working officers or providing better training. These amounts wasted on the witch-hunts could have been used to appoint 118 constables or 93 sergeants or 111 detectives for a year. He said these actions were costing taxpayers millions and this should see both Ntlemeza and Nhleko removed from office. - TMG Digital
