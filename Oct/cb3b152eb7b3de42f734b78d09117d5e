BDE Attorneys has partnered with renowned explorer Kingsley Holgate, musicians Locnville, Springbok rugby player Jesse Kriel, and his brother Daniel, who plays for the Blue Bulls, for a humour-laden fundraising campaign under the hashtags #RhinovemberZA and #PoachingIsNoJoke.Launching today, the initiative hopes to get people to shareanything funny via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram with the two hashtags to create an awareness of and raise cash for anti-poaching initiatives in KwaZulu-Natal.With the heightened awareness, the group intends to collect donations that will go to conservation NGO Project Rhino and help 32 different reserves in KwaZulu-Natal.By the end of August 115 rhino had been poached in KwaZulu-Natal's Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park alone."The idea is that, rather than get depressed about rhino poaching statistics, we spread some cheer during November in honour of these glorious beasts."We hope to raise some money for Project Rhino and the great work that it does, but the priority is to get people talking and participating and thinking about what can be done."If we manage that, we have achieved our objective," said BDE spokesman Anthony Ekerold.In a promo video for the campaign, Holgate, who lives in northern KwaZulu-Natal and is considered the "most travelled man in Africa", said: "I have seen the decimation of our rhino first-hand and believe me this poaching crisis certainly is no joke. That is why I support RhinovemberZA." WINE BOOSTS RHINOSIt started with a conversation in the bush over how a wine company could get involved in the fight against rhino poaching, and now, 20 months later, more than R1-million has been raised to fund anti-poaching initiatives in the Kruger National Park.John Hooper, managing director of the Mt Vernon wine estate in Cape Town, founded the Rhino Tears wine brand in 2015 after spending time with the SA National Parks honorary rangers in the Kruger Park. For every bottle sold, R15 is donated to the honorary rangers.This money - along with other donations - has been used to train anti-poaching dogs, to buy two extreme-terrain vehicles and provide rangers with more than R1.6-million worth of essential equipment.
