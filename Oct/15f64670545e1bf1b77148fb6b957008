NUM accused Sibanye, which has operations in the gold sector, of targeting black workers to make quick profits."We hope Sibanye will not continue retrenching black mineworkers because that is what it has been doing since it took control of gold mines," said NUM spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu.Anglo American Platinum announced yesterday the R4.6-billion sale of its Rustenburg operations to Sibanye .Sibanye spokesman James Wellsted said NUM should not worry. "We're taking over the assets to run them in a sustainable way."There are overlaps in the senior management positions of the company's gold and platinum operations and 514 [workers] will possibly face retrenchment. However, the retrenchments will not be in the category where [NUM members] are represented," he said.
