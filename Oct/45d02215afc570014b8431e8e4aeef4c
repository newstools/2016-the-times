The Golden Lions confirmed that Kriel who has been playing in Japan since the conclusion of the Rugby Championship tore medial cruciate ligaments in his left knee playing for the Kubota Spears. Du Plessis who plays for Montpellier in France has withdrawn for personal reasons. His wife will be giving birth to the couple s third child in early November.He was due to join the Springboks in London in two weeks time to prepare for the Test against England at Twickenham on 12 November. Flank Nizaam Carr and prop Lourens Adriaanse who were both in the squad for the match against the Barbarians at Wembley on November 5 will stay on for the three Tests against England Italy and Wales. Jannie and I had a good conversation on Wednesday evening and he still has a burning desire to be part of the Springboks."However due to his current personal circumstances he unfortunately had to withdraw from the squad said Bok coach Allister Coetzee. Jannie has a wealth of experience he still has a lot to offer and he stays part of our plans. I want to wish him and his wife well as they are looking forward to welcome a third addition to their family. Kriel s injury was only a grade two tear but it will rule him out for a minimum of four weeks. That leaves the uncapped Roelof Smit as the only specialist openside flank on tour with Carr an occasional No 6.- TMG Digital
