Two men followed the toddler s mother Mandisa Mlambo until she got to her home then tied her and a nanny up with rope before robbing them of cellphones and valuables. It hurts so bad. My only baby is still not home a teary Mlambo told reporters at her home on Wednesday. Whoever who has my son I am appealing to you please bring him back. This has been the worst couple of hours of my life she sobbed.The baby's father - who refused to be named - said he was in the neighbourhood not far away from the home his son shares with the mother and the nanny when the incident happened. I can't do anything. I can't eat or even think of anything else. I am so heartbroken. If anyone had an agenda against me they should have just killed me instead and leave my son out of it. He is young he can't even talk he said.There was a sombre mood at the household with family members arriving in numbers at around 6pm. Prayer meetings were being held and occasional sobbing could be heard coming from inside the house.The incident has shocked the small suburb of Protea Glen Extension 28 with neighbours saying they are traumatised. We are all hurt as neighbours. We are also very traumatised as we also have children. My child plays with this little boy who was abducted " said Bertha Mthembu. In the three years that we have lived here this is the first time something like this happens. I have never been this scared in my life said another neighbour who wished not to be named. There was a huge birthday bash for this boy in August. This thing has really upset me because most families here are single parents like your single mothers with a helper and kids only. It s very quiet here unlike your old locations the neighbour added.Police said they are working around the clock to find the baby. A robbery and kidnapping case is being investigated. TMG Digital
