Besides the hair loss and constantly feeling ill, Zoleka has also gained 10kgs.She said that she isn't a comfort eater and has always turned to food, whether she is happy or sad."I can't quite say that I'm a comfort eater because I eat when I'm happy, depressed, anxious, bored, excited and I think even when I'm scared sometimes. Don't laugh at me! I'm working on getting back to 70kgs and minus the Fanta Grape, Dominoes Pizza, Chicken Licken Wings, Burger King extra long chillie cheese, burger, large McDonald's vanilla milkshake, Peppermint Crisp dessert from Woollies, fat cakes and blah, blah, blah that accidentally finds it's way in my mouth."Posting a picture of herself last year, Zoleka said she is determined to get back to where she was."Food just instantly makes me happy but I get how I have cross addicted to food, just something else that makes me feel better - in the same way that I used sex, alcohol and drugs to make me feel better about myself. I'm a work in progress and need to focus more on mindful eating and more exercise!"
