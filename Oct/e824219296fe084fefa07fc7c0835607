Sougson Manasseh Madhihwa Mjasha Target Murima and Amoni Chirwa were sentenced by the Polokwane Magistrate s Court on Tuesday. They had admitted guilt to criminal charges for cruelty to animals laid in terms of the Animals Protection Act No 71 of 1962. All are foreign nationals who were additionally sentenced to 2 months imprisonment to run concurrently for residing illegally in South Africa Grace de Lange of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) said.Criminal charges were laid against the men after a vehicle they were travelling in was intercepted by personnel from the Polokwane SPCA in September. It was travelling from Limpopo and apparently on its way to an abattoir in Randfontein Gauteng with 41 donkeys loaded onto it. Adult males females and foals were all in the same compartment with most of the animals in a state of collapse; crushed dead or dying. Humane euthanasia was undertaken to end the suffering of the severely compromised and suffering animals. The NSPCA expressed horror at the manner in which these donkeys were handled and transported resulting in this unbelievable suffering said De Lange.De Lange said this was not an isolated case and that the NSPCA was investigating other cases of stolen and abused donkeys.
