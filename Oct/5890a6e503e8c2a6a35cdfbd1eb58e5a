Instead, we have a president whose only pronouncements on the matter have been a badly read speech at a hastily convened media conference which he left without hearing input from the students.Amidst the protests, the National Prosecuting Authority's head, Shaun Abrahams, announces that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is being charged with fraud.Unsurprisingly, Zuma was not even in the country as the bombshell hit and sent the rand plummeting and rocked our fragile economy.His comments on the matter were confined to a brief media statement in which he affirmed his support for Gordhan.And then, instead of answering former public protector Thuli Madonsela's questions on state capture, Zuma dodged, choosing instead to interdict the release of her report.Leadership on these matters has instead come from other quarters.The clergy have been at the forefront of trying to negotiate an end to the violent protests at universities.Current and former ANC stalwarts have spoken out on the Gordhan charges. At least 80 heads of top South African companies have called the political wrangling around Gordhan damaging to an already stalling economy.Senior government officials have spoken out against state capture.But all these voices do not have the power that the president's does.Today, Zuma is expected to answer questions in the National Council of Provinces. He can either stay true to form, giggle his way through it and portray himself as the victim of abuse at the hands of the opposition, or he can surprise us and use the platform to be presidential and show true leadership.It's probably too much to ask.
