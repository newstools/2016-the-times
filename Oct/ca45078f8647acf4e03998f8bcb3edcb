Sundowns take a 3-0 lead to Sunday's final and it seems the hosts have gone out of their way to try and unsettle the South Africans.Peeved Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula was not amused when he was told that Sundowns were not able to train after the hosts failed to provide training facilities to the Pretoria club. I have noted with grave concern reports coming from Egypt that Sundowns could not train " Mbalula said."We are irked by such behaviour and condemn it in the strongest terms. These actions have made prestigious championships like CAF not to be respected."All football loving people must frown upon such incidents. This culture is foreign in football and should be done away with. The latest antics follow revelations by Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane that some of his players have received death threats on social media from increasingly desperate Zamalek supporters.But despite the escalating mischief Department of International Relations and Cooperation spokesman Clayson Monyela told Times Media Digital this week they are not too concerned by the obvious acts of gamesmanship the Egyptian are employing.- TMG Digital
