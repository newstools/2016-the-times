Madonsela had planned to release the report into alleged state capture last Friday the last day of her seven-year non-renewable term as public protector.But she could not release it because Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des Van Rooyen and President Jacob Zuma launched separate urgent applications before the high court in Pretoria to prevent the publication of the report.Zuma's application together with applications to intervene by a number of opposition parties will be heard on November 1.In her answering affidavit filed on Friday Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said she would abide the outcome of the applications brought by Zuma and Van Rooyen on their quest to stop the release of the report on state capture.Mkhwebane said she had withdrawn her opposition to the application brought by Van Rooyen and would also abide the outcome of the application brought by Zuma.Van Rooyen has since withdrawn his application.She said she would not oppose any of the applications brought by the opposition parties. In effect I leave the question whether the report relating to the relationship between the Gupta family and the president should be made public or whether the president and Mr van Rooyen should first be granted additional time within which to make representations in the hands of the court Mkhwebane said in her answering affidavit filed with the high court in Pretoria on Friday.She said because she took office on October 15 and as this answering affidavit was to be filed on October 21 she had not had time to familiarise herself with the facts of the applications.Mkwebane said she had also not been able to fully acquaint herself with the processes followed by Madonsela in conducting the investigation and preparing the report.She said it was also unclear from a legal perspective whether she was permitted to revisit the findings contained in a report that had been finalised and signed by Madonsela. - TMG Digital
