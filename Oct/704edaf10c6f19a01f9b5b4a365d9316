But a capacity crowd is still expected at Soccer City tomorrow for the first match between the two since Pirates handed Chiefs a 2-0 defeat in the first round of the Nedbank Cup in March.Eric Tinkler had his tactics perfectly ordered that day as Pirates dominated their archrivals to extend their unbeaten run against Chiefs to five games.But historically this is a fixture that Amakhosi have long dominated and, as they mark the 160th meeting between the two clubs, the Buccaneers would be wise to heed the fact that Chiefs have won 67 times to Pirates' paltry 38, with 49 draws and five abandoned games.Coach Steve Komphela has overcome a poor start to the season to take Chiefs to the top of the Premier Soccer League standings, while Muhsin Ertugral is taking time to fit in at Pirates.Whether his coaching methods are having the desired effect is a question more frequently being posed, and this is an important game for him to establish his credentials.Derby success is often a strong tonic for the psyche, but both Chiefs and Pirates this season face time in the shadow of Sundowns and Bidvest Wits, who look the two clubs most likely to win the league title.The match is M1 in the showcase Soccer 6 pool of the weekend.
