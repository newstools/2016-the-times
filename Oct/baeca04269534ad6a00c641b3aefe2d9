Abrahams met them at the ANC's headquarters just before confirming his decision to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with fraud the Sunday Times revealed on Sunday.The chief prosecutor said the meeting was about the anarchy caused by student protests around the country.DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach however challenged Abrahams on Monday to declare publically the real reasons behind his visit to Luthuli House last week .Should he have nothing to hide he must make the minutes of the meeting publically available she said.Breytenbach described the visit as highly questionable saying it raised ethical questions as the head of the NPA was required to be impartial. The excuse provided by Abrahams that he visited Luthuli House to discuss student protests with the party s leader s falls flat since the Minister of Higher Education the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Police were not present at this this supposed meeting she said. - TMG Digital
