Judge Nape Dolamo of the Cape Town High Court yesterday sentenced Akhona Ntsokotha to 25 years imprisonment for killing Mpendulo Bam for his red T-shirt.Ntsokotha also used an illegal firearm to shoot Bam's friend, Lukho Mazimba.Confronted with overwhelming evidence against him, 25-year-old Ntsokotha, a father of two, entered into a plea and sentencing agreement with the state.The details of his December 2015 crime spree, in the Stellenbosch area of Khayamandi, are blood-curdling. He admitted to the court that he took the T-shirt from Mazimba and refused to return it.The T-shirt belonged to Bam.On December 5, Mazimba and Bam found Ntsokotha wearing the T-shirt and "removed it from his body", according to court papers.Ntsokotha went after the two men and found them at Mazimba's home. He opened fire and hit Mazimba in the hip and a bullet grazed Bam's ear. They fled and sought medical treatment.But he was not done. Seven days later, he pointed a gun at Mazimba and threatened to kill him. The following day he shot and killed Bam at the Khayamandi taxi rank using a semi-automatic firearm.In aggravation of sentence, the prosecution said: "[Ntsokotha's] criminal conduct beginning from 2009 shows a gradation to more violent criminal conduct. [He] has a total disregard for the sanctity of life. The brazenness with which [he] conducted himself is itself aggravating as he persisted with his conduct knowing that the T-shirt did not belong to him. The deceased lost his life for a mere T-shirt."Bam's brother, Mfuneko, said he welcomed the sentence. "I am satisfied with the sentence. He is exactly where he belongs."
