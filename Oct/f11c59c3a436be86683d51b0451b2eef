But then there was an awkward follow-up question.DA MP Willem Faber had asked Zuma about the position of the country s economic stability given the ongoing investigation of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Zuma appeared comfortable even authoritative as read out his written reply.But then Faber asked follow-up questions: "Mr President when did you learn of Shaun Abrahams' intention to charge Pravin Gordhan was this discussed with Mr Abrahams' visit to Luthuli House in a meeting with yourself and ministers a day before charging the minister of finance?"Zuma cleared his throat and throughout his reply the irritation in his throat appeared to be back with a vengeance."Honourable chair firstly the matter of the minister I think the member should appreciate that the matter is before court and I do not think we could be discussing details of that matter when it is before court."And I must also say that the matter was never discussed with Abrahams and the president. Never never never and the meeting the honourable member is referring to was a meeting between the security cluster discussing a totally different matter."- TMG Digital
