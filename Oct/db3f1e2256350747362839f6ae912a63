Two goals in the last six minutes just as the tie was headed to post-match penalties saw City become the first side to book a berth in the last eight of the cup competition. I took a risk making as many changes as I did said Tinker. We had players starting to cramp. We had players literally making their debuts Robyn (Johannes) hadn t played an official 90 minutes this season and he got through two hours."The same situation for Thamsanqa Mkhize who was making his debut. I thought both of them did exceptionally well."Tinkler's delight was a marked change from the irritation he had after City lost at home to Baroka in the league on Saturday necessitating the seven changes he made for the cup tie. Defensively we were much better. When I looked at Celtic at least the games I ve watched they are a far better team than what their league situation states."They have a lot of pace but I felt that we dealt with it. The shots they had at our goal came from outside the box and didn t really cause us any major threat. But even then it was only in the second half of extra time that we were able to find space and then only because of the fatigue of our opponents."I said to the players once we started extra time that now it s all about who wants it more. Who is prepared to run further than the other."They re tired you re tired. Now we going to see who has got the bee s knees . I think we showed that added the City coach. - TMG Digital
