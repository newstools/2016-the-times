Former Ajax Amsterdam legend Menzo was something of a journeyman goalkeeper who earned six caps for the famous Dutch team of the trio of Frank Rijkaard, Marco van Basten and Ruud Gullit.He played for clubs including Ajax Amsterdam, where he earned 249 caps, PSV Eindhoven and Lierse in Belgium and Bordeaux in France in a 19-year career spanning 1983 to 2002.He said in an Ajax Cape Town statement: I am excited to take up the position as head coach, although we are not in a good position on the PSL log currently. We will work together as a club to improve, starting from today. What s important now is getting the players confident for the remainder of the season and bring back the Ajax winning feeling. De Sa quit on Thursday, a day after Ajax s 2-1 defeat to Bidvest Wits at Cape Town Stadium.The Urban Warriors have not win in their first six league matches of the season, and are in second-bottom place after four defeats and two draws have netted just two points.Ajax CEO Ari Efstathiou sang the praises of Menzo, saying: Stanley has played more than 300 games in top European clubs, 249 of them for Ajax Amsterdam. He has represented Holland on international level. He managed and assisted in top-tier European clubs and also assisted Marco van Basten at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. We are confident that Stanley will enhance the Ajax philosophy and playing system at the club and together with Mich D Avray as his assistant will bring Ajax Cape Town back to winning ways. Menzo faces a difficult task, though, taking charge of an inexperienced Ajax squads that has lost far too many big-name players in recent seasons.He has managed clubs including Volendam in Holland and Lierse. The ex-goalkeeper had been appointed Ajax Cape Town's head of youth in April. - TMG Digital Sport
