De Kock scored 122 out of SA s total of 415 despite having to bat in daylight in the twilight zone before the artificial lighting established its dominance and after dark. I actually thought it was quite nice batting during the twilight period De Kock told reporters. Early on it was about getting used to it and I found that a little bit more difficult. But I think that s part of any white-ball red-ball cricket anyway the first couple of balls. So when I started getting used to it and started getting in it was much easier. De Kock s approach to surviving and prospering against cricket s newest innovation was impressively colourblind. To me there s no difference he said. I m not one to over-think it - a ball s a ball and I just play the way I should be playing in that situation. You could see everything nothing was different ... from the normal four-day game at that time of the day. De Kock s innings ended when he retired - not so much because he had had his fill but because he is suffering from a viral infection and is ill enough to have been ruled out of keeping wicket on Sunday.Dane Vilas who will be the reserve wicketkeeper in the squad is at Newlands playing a first-class match for the Cobras against the Warriors.That means SA s keeper on Sunday will be Harry Nielsen a member of the South Australia under-23 squad.Hashim Amla scored a seamless 51 before retiring and JP Duminy looked in promising form for his 97.The home side s inexperienced attack was one factor in the ease with which SA adapted to the unusual conditions.Then there was the fact that the grass on the pitch was only 6 mm long compared to the 8 mm sported at the same venue for the inaugural day/night test in November - when Australia beat New Zealand inside three days in a match that lasted for only 251.2 of the scheduled 450 overs.But the visitors batsmen all looked comfortable at the crease and will be satisfied that they passed the pink test. - TMG Digital
