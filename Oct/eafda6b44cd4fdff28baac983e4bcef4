Pearl took to Twitter on Sunday to share a verse from the book of Proverbs in the bible."'Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it'' Proverbs 2:23," Pearl posted on Twitter.But some of her followers didn't feel the same spirit as Pearl and took to Twitter to let her know that there was no such scripture in the bible.They pointed out that Pearl had in fact quoted the wrong chapter and should have written "Proverbs 4:23".Pearl had no time for the petty Twitter pastors and told them to "get over it".That one...
