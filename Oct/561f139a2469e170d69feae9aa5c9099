This time evidence focused on the amounts withdrawn from her account on the morning she disappeared.Johannes Thomas area manager in charge of Nedbank ATMs in the Eastern Cape told the court how he was asked to establish transactions made on two bank cards.He said an attempt was first made one on card to withdraw R3000 at the Picardi ATM in KwaNobuhle.That transaction was declined.A second attempt to withdraw R3000 this time on the other card was also declined.Then at 7.28am on April 21 R1500 was successfully withdrawn at Nedbank. The records indicated the same card was used a minute later to withdraw R600 but this transaction was declined.Earlier in the day defence advocate Terry Price SC poked holes in much of the testimony of Warrant Officer Johannes Botes who claimed he was present when alleged triggerman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke was read his rights.Testimony continues on Wednesday.- TMG Digital/The Herald
