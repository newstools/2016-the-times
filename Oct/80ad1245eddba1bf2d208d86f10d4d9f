The alleged altercation led Angelina to file for divorce from the actor on September 19, sources previously told US magazine.According to TMZ, law enforcement officials questioned Angelina and the children in a three-hour meeting, where the actress and the kids had to walk through the incident step-by-step, primarily so that they could determine where the incident occurred.Apparently it matters whether the plane was actually in US airspace when the fight happened. The FBI agents also had questions as to what happened when the plane refueled in Minnesota, since there is some question over jurisdiction.TMZ reports that they are in a fact-finding stage to see if there s even enough evidence for an actual investigation. Angelina was reportedly cooperative during the meeting, but would rather the whole situation "just go away".
