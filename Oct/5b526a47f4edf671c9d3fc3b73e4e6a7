Siya Mlambo was abducted at his home when two men attacked his mother Mandisa tying up her and a nanny with rope before taking valuables and making off with the toddler on Tuesday evening. I just stayed up all night and stared at his toys. I slept with my mother in the room I share with him and I just looked at his toys lying around Mlambo said on Thursday. I miss him so much. I can t do anything I need him back. I miss shouting at him because he is a very naughty baby. I miss his laughter and just playing with him. I tried very hard to take my mind off things and suppress the emotions but I can't. I just want my baby Mlambo added.There were no arrests made by Thursday morning but police said they are working on the matter. We are studying the CCTV footage of the suspect at an ATM on the night of the kidnapping. That s the only solid evidence we have at the moment " police spokesperson Mpande Khoza said.Mlambo appealed for the safe return of her child. I asked them to take anything else but my son. I even offered them my car but they refused and took him. I just want the person who took him to come back and let s talk about what they really want Mlambo said.- TMG Digital
