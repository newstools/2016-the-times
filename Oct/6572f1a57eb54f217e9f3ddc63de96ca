About the most exciting part of Downs flight home from Egypt was when the team were waiting in the duty-free area in Cairo International Airport and being mobbed by fans wanting to get a touch of or photo with their Caf Champions League trophy.Downs and their coach in characteristically friendly South African fashion did not want to turn anyone down and their security staff had to patiently wait for in-demand famous piece of silverware to be passed around among countless nationalities.Sundowns were crowned Champions League winners with a 1-0 defeat against Zamalek at Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria but 3-1 aggregate victory on Sunday night.They stayed in Egypt until Tuesday night moving from Alexandria to Cairo on Monday then training in the capital until their departure ahead of their Telkom Knockout first round fixture against Polokwane City at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Thursday evening.In Cairo Downs were invited as guests to a wedding of an Egyptian couple in their hotel along with the honoured guest the Champions League trophy.Their flight home was a subdued one the exhausted team and their equally tired fans who had been treated as celebrities in Alexandria and as much of a photo opportunity as the trophy just wanting to get some sleep after a long emotional journey to being kings of Africa. - TMG Digital
