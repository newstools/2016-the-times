"I've got a bone to pick with you, and I'm really mad at you, and I'm disappointed at you Charlamagne Tha God," Sbu said during his show on Wednesday morning."I'm mad at you, because when you had to mention my boy Cassper Nyovest's name, you said even if you knew the name, you wouldn't give a damn because you wouldn't be able to pronounce it anyway. And then you said he's 'some African artist'. Now that shows your ignorance when it comes to African people and African artists. I challenge you to have Cassper Nyovest on your show." Shortly after, Charlamagne took to Twitter to respond to Sbu's challenge, asserting that he has spoken to Cassper and told him that he is welcome to visit his show at anytime.@Djsbu You don't have to challenge me to do anything. I told Casper he's welcome anytime hours ago sir. Be blessed.While Cassper might have been excited about making it onto US radio, he was also disappointed about being referred to as 'some artist in Africa'."I listened to the lil clip on the breakfast club and after I got over the trip, I realised how I was still from "Some Artist in Africa," he tweeted."They will never respect us until we respect ourselves. It starts with us. We need to be more patriotic. Africa has so so so much talent," he added.After Charlamagne saw the string of tweets by Cassper, he acknowledged that they tried to pronounce his name but couldn't.
