Speaking at a meeting held at the University of Witwatersrand Madonsela said the #FeesMustFall demands cannot be solved purely at the level of the university. I believe that we have to bring government on board. We have to indicate to government that this is what we are demanding and this is what we are able to settle for Let us make sure that there is peace Madonsela said. When I was Public Protector we were confronted with situations where there were fights and the police were being placed as a buffer between the people and government. Police told us they don t want to be a buffer between their own people and government. They participated in a dialogue such as this one where an agreement was reached she said.Wednesday s meeting was held at the university s main campus to try to find a lasting solution to the protests by students who are demanding free higher education.Madonsela told the meeting that police do not want to be a buffer for the state. They said they want to be there for us when we harm each other. As human beings we harm each other we need police to be there for us. We also don t want police who are our fathers brothers and sisters to be hated in our communities as was the case under apartheid. Let government and the people talk. Let us find peaceful solutions. She then thanked the student community for taking a leadership role as young people. Thank you for leading us. You have shown us that age does not matter. When it is your time to lead you must step up.
