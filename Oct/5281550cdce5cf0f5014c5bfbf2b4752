Forensic pathologist Dr Robert Gabriel Ngude told the South Gauteng High Court sitting in the Randburg Magistrate's Court that Nosipho Mandleleni 24 died because of excessive loss of blood and blunt force trauma.Ngude said a broom stick and sjambok found on the murder scene were consistent with his findings of the "blunt force trauma"."It is not impossible but unlikely for the victim at the time to change her clothes. The deceased sustained injuries on her front back left and right sides of her body. The time of the attack would depend on the encounter between two people. Probably the deceased could have been static. The deceased had defensive wounds."Ngude confirmed that Mandleleni's body had old scars on her back and it would have been difficult to establish how she got them.He said it was difficult to say how long it would have taken the deceased to succumb to her injuries. "The way we tolerate injury is different and it would have been difficult to say how she succumbed to the injuries " he said.Ngude was the last witness to testify against Wisani 30 before state prosecutor Faghre Mohamed closed his case.The former ANCYL Johannesburg inner city chairman who is representing himself then opted to bring an application to have charges against him withdrawn when the matter resumes on Tuesday. Judge Mohamed Ismail denied Wisani's plea to have the case postponed for a week in order for him to prepare his application.It is alleged that on September 5 2015 Wisani beat Mandleleni to death with a sjambok and a broomstick in a room they were sharing together at 49 Webb Street in Yeoville Johannesburg.His R3000 bail was revoked earlier this year for allegedly assaulting Mandleleni's twin sister Siphokazi and and her friend Zimbini Mathibe.Siphokazi earlier testified that Wisani slapped punched and kicked her threatening her to kill her like he killed her twin sister and threatened her not to testify against him. Mathibe who is Wisani's ex-lover was allegedly slapped and throttled when she tried to intervene.The trial continues.- TMG Digital/Sowetan
