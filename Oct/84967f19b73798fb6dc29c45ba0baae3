That's the conclusion of US-funded research into the success of the world's most ambitious circumcision programme, which has seen 1.8million foreskin removals in five years."The direct labour costs of circumcision could be reduced by 17%, with the task shifting from doctors to professional nurses," said Tanzanian researcher Michel Tchuenche in the journal PLOS One.He said the cost of each circumcision performed in 2014 was R1431.Department of Health spokesman Joe Maila expressed appreciation for the research."We have to look at it carefully and see what is usable in our context," the spokesman said.
