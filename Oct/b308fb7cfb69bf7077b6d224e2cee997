They were treated along with several other students at the Campus Health and Wellness Centre. Two students had to be taken to hospital the university said. It said the protesting students had entered the Flower Hall where they had torn up test papers towards the end of a chemical engineering test just after midday. They then made their way to the New Commerce Building where they disrupted lectures before making their way to the Wits Science Stadium. Police dispersed the protesting group using teargas rubber bullets and stun grenades. The university said the disruption of the test had occurred as a result of a lapse in security around these venues in the morning. The tests scheduled for the remainder of the day went ahead without disruption. All test venues and lecture theatres will be secured going forward it stated.It added that about 95% of all classes at Wits had gone ahead on Thursday across all campuses.
