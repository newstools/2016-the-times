 I do believe in the independence of the judiciary and that Pravin Gordhan is perfectly right to fight this case unless there is something that has not been revealed by the person who is prosecuting him because it looks to me like something that is not a big deal Sunter told a Deloitte function on Monday morning.Gordhan who is scheduled to table the medium-term budget in Parliament on Wednesday will appear in court on November 2 on fraud charges relating to the granting of early retirement of Ivan Pillay from the South African Revenue Service. Sunter again called for an economic Codesa chaired by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa where township entrepreneurs would be invited to make presentations on which ways could best ensure their inclusion in the broader economy.Speaking at the same function political analyst Justice Malala said some of SA's institutions will be used to fight the battle between "divided" African National Congress (ANC) comrades.On the upcoming medium term budget Malala said he expected fiscal consolidation to continue being the message.He added that while speculation was rife a Cabinet reshuffle was not "a foregone conclusion" as President Jacob Zuma will have noted the consequences to markets if important portfolios such as Finance were affected.
