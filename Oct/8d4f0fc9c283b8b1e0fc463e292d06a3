That s what the Democratic Alliance said it had been reliably informed that the South African Broadcasting Corporation s (SABC) Hlaudi Motsoeneng announced to staff at the bargaining unit on Wednesday.The party s Phumzile Van Damme said on Thursday that the payment of R10 000 will be to all staff excluding middle senior and top management and is said to amount to R32-million and would require board approval . It is quite clear that this sweetener deal is nothing but an attempt for Motsoeneng to get SABC staff on his side as a last-ditch attempt to save his hide she said. Mostsoeneng should be nowhere near the SABC; never mind looting its coffers and further adding to the public broadcaster s losses of close to half a billion last financial year. She said her party would be submitting parliamentary questions to ascertain which budget this money comes from how it was approved and whether the board was involved in the process . TMG Digital
