This comes in the wake of the release of retired deputy chief justice and liberation struggle stalwart Dikgang Moseneke s published memoirs My Own Liberator.In it Moseneke makes reference to a young activist by the name of Nathi Nhleko who is involved in a politically motivated murder trial in the 1980s.The activist in the book led the necklacing of a 78-year-old resident and traditional healer in a tiny Eastern Cape township news Queenstown.In a statement released on Friday Nhleko said he wished to distance himself from the person mentioned and any incidents associated with him. Since the current Minister of Police Nkosinathi Nhleko shares a first and last name with the person mentioned in the book a wrong impression has been created in the minds that he is the person in question the ministry said.Nhleko said: I would like to place it on record that I have never murdered anyone nor been convicted of a murder nor lived in Queenstown. I am definitely not the person judge Moseneke writes about. Moseneke s autobiography which was published this month covers his life as a child his education family and the 15 years he spent on Robben Island. TMG Digital
