Yusuf Abramjee social activist and co-chair of the newly formed Anti Visa Fee South Africa committee told TMG Digital that the fee increments that came into effect this month were too high. What it amounts to is that anyone going for pilgrimage to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is forced to pay about SR2000 (about R7300) and we are rejecting that said Abramjee. We objected to the fee hike as the South African Muslim community and we formed a group two weeks ago called the Anti Visa Fee South Africa committee. Muslims in other parts of the world have also opposed the increase saying it will make it difficult for many to travel to the holy land. Countries like Egypt and Morocco are boycotting Umrah and Hajj. We in South Africa took a decision that we will not boycott the pilgrimage it will be wrong to do that from a religious point of view. This morning I was told that only 45 South Africans were granted visas which means that people are not travelling said Abramjee.He said it was unfair that Muslims in countries that Saudi Arabia has bilateral agreements with - such as Britain and United States of America - are exempted from the fee hike.Abramjee said his committee has approached the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) as well as the Saudi embassy to intervene and oppose the fee hike but it hadn t received any feedback.An online petition against the hike has garnered over 10 000 signatures in the last two weeks he claimed.The Muslim Judicial Council declined to comment saying it will only do so when they get feedback from the Saudi Arabian ambassador and Dirco. We won t take a position until we have been officially notified said spokesperson Nabeweya Malik.- TMG Digital
