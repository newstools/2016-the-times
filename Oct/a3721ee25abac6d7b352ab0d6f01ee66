In a lengthy statement on his Twitter page Trevor said that he has a respiratory and ear infection and would not be able to host the show."Due to the infection and strain on my vocal chords the doctor has ordered me to rest. I desperately wish I could dismiss the doctor but the added risk of flying means the decision would be highly irresponsible and may cause further damage."While Trevor said that he is disappointed and MTV has announced that Bonang Matheba would step in, his fans have been poking fun at the comedian.His official Facebook fan page has been filled with comments by South Africans taking shots at the star."Haai Trevor you're becoming soft man. You should have spoken sooner, you know ugogo at that house would have fixed inton-nton and you'd be sorted.
