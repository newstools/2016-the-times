Six of Pirates seven goals in the Premier Soccer League this season have come from in-form Zimbabwean Ndoro. Thabiso Kutumela scored the other in a home draw against Platinum Stars in late September.Ndoro though can be frustratingly anonymous in matches which accounts in part for Bucs inconsistency so far in 2016-17.Ertugral would have been pleased to see Pirates register a convincing 2-1 Telkom Knockout first round victory against Lamontville Golden Arrows at Orlando Stadium on Sunday where two stunning goals were scored by Mpho Makola and Luvuyo Memela.The coach said that as Pirates continue to adapt to his game plan so the goals will continue to be spread around. First you are asking the wrong person and second I have not restricted my other players not to score and only Tendai to score Ertugral responded when asked why Bucs forwards other than Ndoro have been slow to come to the scoring party. So everybody should score. I think sometimes we are also a bit unlucky. But Memela scored a fantastic goal I think this is one of the goals of the season. I think it will become better from us in the coming weeks and months because the positioning was not good from us when we were going forward. And our wingers sometimes dropped too far and then when the ball comes in it is always two or three metres behind into the attacking formation. We have been working on those things. And sometimes it is not all that easy because we have been decoding [undoing] the movements that the players have been doing for all those years. Pirates have nine points from five games in the PSL. With two wins in the league Bucs had drawn their last three PSL games then beat Arrows 2-1 in the Telkom in a far more convincing manner than the 2-1 scoreline suggests. - TMG Digital Sport
