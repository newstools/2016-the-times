This came after a two-hour intense debate concerning the famous red overalls dress code by the EFF members who have consistently been removed from BCM council meetings for this dress code.According to BCM rules the red overalls and makarabas were in contravention of the approved dress code for councillors when attending council meetings.Mtsi called the police officers to remove the councillors after they refused to leave the chambers stating that there was nothing wrong with how they were dressed.However their removal quickly became a physical fight between the councillors and police officers leaving many - including EFF supporters - injured during the fight outside the chambers.
