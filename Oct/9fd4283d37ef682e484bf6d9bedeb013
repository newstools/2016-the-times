The exceptional case, filed on Monday, is being heard by a civilian court in Geneva, said Jerome Sobel, who heads Exit in the French-speaking western region of Switzerland.The 82-year-old Swiss man, whose name has not been disclosed, had initially set the date of October 18 for putting an end to his life, Sobel said.He informed his five brothers and sisters, two of whom then filed suit.His plan for suicide, which requires court approval, has been put on hold while the complaint is heard. It is expected to take a maximum of three months.The brothers contend that their sibling -- a member of Exit for more than two decades -- is suffering from temporary depression and is not acting of his own free will.Exit says he has "multiple aged-related disabilities" and says he has written a letter attesting to "intolerable" mental and physical suffering.Under Switzerland's right-to-die laws, patients self-administer a lethal dose prescribed by a doctor acting for a not-for-profit assisted suicide association.
