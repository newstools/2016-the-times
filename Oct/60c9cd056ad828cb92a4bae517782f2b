Nompilo Innocentia Mpanza 31 together with Xolani Victor Ntshingila 25 and Thokozani Mpanza were arrested last week in Newcastle KwaZulu-Natal after the abduction of Siyabonga aged 14 months.Siyabonga made headlines last week when he was abducted during an armed robbery at his parents' home in Protea Glen Soweto.The baby's father Tshepo Modubung said the incident had left him hopeless that he would need to find another person to look after his son while he and his partner Mandisa Mbali Mlambo were away.Nompilo Mpanza is related to Mlambo.The three are facing charges of kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances. I want to thank the entire community of South Africa our friends neighbours families especially the police who helped us in finding Siya alive. We need justice for what happened to Siya Modubung said.Ntshingila who was in tears throughout the trio's brief appearance before Magistrate Audrey Mpofu complained that he was in pain. I am hurting and was severely assaulted by police when they arrested us. My ribs and arms are in pains and have never seen a doctor he said wiping tears from his cheeks.Mpanza also complained that police punched her and that she was kicked all over her body.The soft-spoken Mpofu then ordered that the two receive medical attention.Ntshingila also told the court that he wanted to correct a statement he had made to the police. He said some of the thing he had said were true but others were false because he was assaulted at the time.Mpofu then advised Ntshingila to tell that to his lawyer and that the lawyer must raise it in court.Thokozani and Ntshingila have opted to be represented by the Legal Aid Board while Mpanza promised to bring her own lawyer.This is after Mpofu read them their rights and advised them not to represent themselves because they were facing serious offences which would result in lengthy jail terms should they be convicted.Thokozani Mpanza said that in 2008 he was convicted of shoplifitng and sentenced to five months in prison. The following year he was again sentenced to three years for shoplifting. In 2014 he was arrested for robbery and was acquitted.In February 2016 he was sentenced to six months again for shoplifting and spent two months in jail before being released by parole.The three are expected back in court on November 10 for a formal bail application.- TMG Digital/Sowetan
