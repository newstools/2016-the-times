This is according to KwaZulu-Natal premier Willies Mchunu, speaking at a press conference yesterday. He outlined the terms of reference of a commission of inquiry into the province's political violence.Mchunu estimated that the inquiry would cost about R15-million and take about a year.He said bloody faction fighting and political clashes over many decades had provided a fertile breeding ground for political intolerance ."KwaZulu-Natal has a history. It has become culture in KwaZulu-Natal to live within wars, to live with fighting. Even in my own Mchunu tribe we killed one another. Political violence did not start yesterday," he said.Mchunu's comments were made as the government desperately tries to find solutions to end the political killings in the province.At least 20 people were killed in KwaZulu-Natal in the run-up to the August 3 local government elections.Mchunu said the commission would investigate these killings and others dating back to 2011.Much of the violence this year has involved ANC council candidates and some say that the killings are attributable to internal party clashes .Of the 20 dead this year, 12 were ANC members.Mchunu acknowledged that internal politics could be a factor in the violence, and said the commission should look into this."There is nothing that we are leaving out. At this stage we want no stone to be left unturned," he said."The other matter that has to be addressed by the commission is the safety of those who are going to speak [to it]."There are people who are going to speak confidentially. People are going to have information but will be scared to come there, or be scared to even be seen close to the commission's offices. I'm talking from experience."
