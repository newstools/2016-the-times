The moment was caught on camera and, well, has set off a massive call from fans.DJ Fresh echoed the sentiment during his show on 5FM."I reckon they should perform together. Imagine. AKA on one side. Cassper on another. I'd pay to see that. In fact, I dare them."We all do!Would they consider a union of some kind?Well, insiders told us that even if they don't attempt to fill up FNB together, then Cassper has already made his mind up that AKA should be involved in some way."Even if he just performs, Cassper would be happy with that. He's keen on sharing the stage. Maybe not for the whole show, but definitely an appearance of some sort,"said our source.*We be like this in the office* via GIPHY
