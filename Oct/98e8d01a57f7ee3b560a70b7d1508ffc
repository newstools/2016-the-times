Mahlangu made this announcement while presenting the Department s Annual Report for the period 2015/2016 to the Health Portfolio Committee and members of the public in Orange Farm on Friday.According to Mahlangu for the period under review about 3 040 new cases of severe acute malnutrition were identified and out of those about 1512 children were admitted at different facilities with 113 deaths attributed to severe acute malnutrition.Once malnutrition is at acute stage there is high mortality Mahlangu said adding that it was extremely important to detect it at earlier stages.Vulnerable children with suspected moderate or severe malnutrition are identified at primary health centres and referred to hospitals for final diagnosis using a World Health Organisation classification protocol and put on appropriate treatment. In our effort to fight the scourge of malnutrition we will make sure that children do not reach hospitals very late with an advanced disease condition which could lead to fatality. Our Antenatal Care will continue to identify women at risk of malnutrition due to low income... and provide them with food supplementations. The Department of Social Development will continue provide food parcels Mahlangu said.The MEC encouraged exclusive breastfeeding for six months in order to avoid children s chances of suffering from malnutrition. - TMG Digital
