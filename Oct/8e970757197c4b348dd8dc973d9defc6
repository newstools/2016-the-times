A crowdfunding initiative to raise funds for Jake and his friends was launched this week and aims to raise R2.7 million. The campaign has already raised over R12,000 in less than 24 hours.Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, US-based artist Solomon Adufah explained that Jake was part of the Homeland Series outreach programme he held in Ghana."Jake was one of the children I taught in Ghana. He was always gentle and quiet. Ever present in class and was eager to learn every day," Solomon said of Jake.Solomon also lamented at the fact that the image is often used as a joke or as a source of mockery."I wish the positive aspect of this image will go viral instead of how it's being portrayed as. I understand it's something I can't control. I can only continue to positively impact the lives of people with my talent and purpose," he added.Meanwhile local musician Thiwe has also warned people to be wary of scammers, who are pretending to be Jake's parents and are collecting donations for him.
