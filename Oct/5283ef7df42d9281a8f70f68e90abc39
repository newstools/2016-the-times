This will probably get off to a late and rocky start with opposition parties likely to question him on his attempt to prevent the public protector s state capture report being released particularly after fresh details about it emerged over the weekend.Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has indicated that he will ask a parliamentary question about Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas affidavit which said Ajay Gupta offered him R600 000 in cash and a further R600 million to be paid in instalments in return for supporting the nuclear build programme .Ajay Gupta 'offered millions' to Jonas to 'work with us'That affidavit is contained in the public protector s report - Zuma s application to have its release interdicted will be heard last week.The claims by Jonas are likely to dominate a meeting of the Multiparty Whips Forum which precedes Zuma s question session by about six hours.The African National Congress chief whip in the National Assembly Jackson Mthembu broke ranks over the weekend and called for the top leadership of the ruling party to resign.His comments show divisions with the ANC as leading members have said the justice system is being used for political ends in the decision to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with fraud charges.Those charges face a court challenge on Monday from Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation.In September Zuma watched a walkout by opposition parties while at an appearance in the house in May he remarked to Speaker Baleka Mbete after being heckled: I believe your House needs to do more to bring this House into order. I go around Africa and people ask me very embarrassing questions about this Parliament.
