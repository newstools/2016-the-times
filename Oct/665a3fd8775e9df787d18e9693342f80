Guardiola's appreciation of his star striker has seemed lukewarm of late, leading to questions over the Argentine's future with City, but the Spaniard could only be grateful for Aguero and two-goal Ilkay Gundogan ending the worst managerial run of his career.After six matches without a win, City were back to their irresistible early-season best, Aguero striking superbly twice in the space of seven minutes midway through the first half.Aguero also put paid to West Brom's impressive second-half resurgence with the exquisite flick that put in Gundogan for City's third -- the goal that ensures they stay top of the league -- before the German international sealed his own double a minute from time.
