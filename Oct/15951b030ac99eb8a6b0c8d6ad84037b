 This new attempt to undermine the Office of the Public Protector comes after President Zuma previously approached the North Gauteng High Court in order to interdict the release of the State Capture report stating that he had not had adequate time to respond to the Public Protector s questions. This is despite the fact that he was informed on 22 March 2016 of the allegations made against him Maimane said in a statement on Thursday.He added that the DA as an intervening party and complainant in this matter was ready to state its case on November 1 at the North Gauteng High Court. We will not subject the people of South Africa to President Zuma s political games and 11th hour interventions. President Zuma s continued and coordinated attempts to delay the release of the State Capture report leave us to conclude that the contents of the report will be the straw that breaks the camel s back.
