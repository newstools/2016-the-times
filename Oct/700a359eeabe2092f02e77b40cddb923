Twitter of course was quick to poke fun at the situation: Ease off #Zuma .He was sleeping cause he suffers from #corruptabetes- meaning anything righteous puts him to sleep,or deaf to man of #truth "I concentrate better with my eyes closed" is the only valid reason why Zuma was sleeping during the speech. This applies to me too. ALL MEDIA: Msholozi was NOT sleeping. He was applying his mind to a dream. He has big dreams. Sometimes they go on for 15 minutes. pic.twitter.com/AeT3KGNyQ8Sleeping in class.....detention for you baba! #Zuma #MTBPS2016 pic.twitter.com/KnFDEzx5GT Pres. Jacob Zuma was not sleeping in Parliament he was praying! Qha media will tell you otherwise ! Do not be fools. Zuma did not 'doze off' in parliament. He was robbed of oxygenated air which was captured by the Ruperts #TweetLikePaidTwitter Maybe if President Zuma don't issue all the late night statements, he won't have to doze off in Parliament. pic.twitter.com/ieNk3hLj1j
