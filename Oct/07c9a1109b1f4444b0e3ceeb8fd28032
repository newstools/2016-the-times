"The only time I'll go back (to the SABC) is as CEO," the radio personality told DRUM."But if I don't get it before I'm 40, I'm not interested."The drive-time presenter, who has since launched his own online channel, Touch Central, left more than a million listeners wondering what had sparked his departure after he resigned.However, he set the record straight during an interview on Cliffcentral, where he revealed that there is no bad blood between him and the SABC."I was happy to complete a journey of a good life span and you can never discount the opportunity that the SABC afforded both Gareth and I," he said.A few months before Touch officially resigned he was suspended by the station, amid rumours of a physical altercation - an allegation that he previously denied.The radio jock explained in detail what led to his suspension: "I've always been the type of person who pushes boundaries. My ideas aggravated certain people. When I was asked to cut certain features, I refused. I was asked to stop certain things on air, and I refused."He added that it was during his suspension that he realised it was just time to move on."I got a lot of offers during my suspension and I had to remind myself that my gift got me here. So, I asked myself, 'why you still allow yourself to go through what you're going through when you're on demand."
