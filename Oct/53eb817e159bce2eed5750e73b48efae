At a meeting on Wednesday in Giyani, Motsoeneng urged traditional leaders to take a more active role after they called for more Xitsonga content on the national broadcaster . "Some say Hlaudi is a tribalist - no. I go where I am called. The Venda nation called us and addressed similar issues of airing Tshivenda content and we went to them. It's high time traditional leaders, not just Tsonga traditional leaders, but all traditional leaders, start working with SABC to make sure that all 11 official languages are represented at national broadcast."We urge you as traditional leaders to take part in naming of our radio stations in a way that will represent our culture. We are tired of having names like Radio Lotus and so forth," he said, taking a swipe at the Indian cultural content station."At SABC we have introduced 90 percent local content. This does not only include musicians but also drama, news and cultural contents. We want to give a chance to upcoming producers ... to take part rather than giving British and Americans money and airtime. We used to take R600 million abroad just to watch the Queen of Britain the whole day; but since we said 90 percent local content that R600 million is used to pay local artists and create jobs for our people in the country."He also urged traditional leaders to become members of the SABC board and parliamentary portfolio committee."The SABC and parliamentary portfolio must consist of traditional leaders rather than politicians, who wants to push the agenda of their parties." He also promised Xitsonga content on the national broadcaster, but warned them they would need professionals to produce the content to maintain the standard. Vhembe house of traditional leaders chairperson, Hosi Busa Nxumalo said, "We were really worried as Xitsonga nation that we are sidelined, we don't have Xitsonga soapie and cultural documentaries like other tribes do. We hope that Mr Hlaudi has heard our cry." African Eye News Service
