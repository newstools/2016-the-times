Shaeera Kalla, a prominent voice in the ongoing fees protests, was allegedly shot at Wits University while engaging police to allow for peaceful protests.Another student leader, Busisiwe Seabe, was hospitalised after experiencing difficulty breathing.Details of the incident are sketchy, with several versions of what transpired doing the rounds.Former SRC secretary general Fasiha Hassen claimed Kalla was shot while addressing students.Last night Kalla said from hospital she was in extreme pain. "Even as we sit in a hospital bed and others languish in prisons, I take strength from students across the country continuing the fight."Police spokesman Sally de Beer said the incident was being investigated. "Members of the SAPS are again called upon to exercise maximum restraint and to act within the confines of the law," she said.Students at Unisa, Tshwane University of Technology and University of Pretoria marched to the Union Buildings to hand over a memorandum to the Department of Higher Education and Training.They refused to hand it over to officials, demanding Minister Blade Nzimande be present to receive it.At Cape Peninsula University of Technology students held a tense meeting to raise 24 issues, including demanding for university workers embroidered uniforms, a minimum wage of R12000 and sanitary towels. Six hours into the meeting only four topics had been discussed and near-chaos erupted when vice-chancellor Prins Nevhutalu tried to leave the hall to answer his phone.While free education featured, outsourcing was a focal point.Cleaner Maritza Williams, 54, cried when she revealed she could not feed her children on her R2900 a month salary.A female student was booed when she called for a referendum on whether to shut campus."I don't think that there is a unanimous decision among students that the university be shut down," she said before being pushed aside by male students.University spokesman Lauren Kansley said the disruptors were a small group of people."The people who were present there [yesterday] are just a small percentage of the CPUT community. We have 30,000 students and 5,000 staff members," said Kansley.
