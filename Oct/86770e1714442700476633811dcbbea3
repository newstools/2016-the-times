Expectations were definitely being managed, which was understandable given the injuries England have suffered recently."When you lose good players there are gaps to fill. We have got to fill those gaps and if the preparation is good enough and the players are good enough - which I know they are - then we will fill those gaps and be ready to go again."And if we are not, which can happen, then we will have to look at how we have prepared and look at the players we have selected and see if we can do better," he said.There were the constant references to England's woeful winless record in 13 matches since 2006 against South Africa, their opponents on November 12."They have got a great record at Twickenham and they have got a great record against England. And history plays a part in influencing psychological attitudes in Test matches. Obviously it hasn't been right over a period of time and we need to get it right against South Africa because they are going to bring something different to the table, and we know what that is."It is going to be full-on, physical pressure and we have to meet that and play good rugby."And of what is in store for the players at their training camp in Portugal this week."One of our big things in Portugal is getting that psychology right. But it will be a bit of technical, physical, social and psychological. We've basically got to put a new team together."On captain Dylan Hartley he said: "It's a bit of a captaincy examination for him. He's not going to have those lieutenants he had around in the past so he's going to have to regenerate the team the way they operate. I'm very confident that he'll do that well."If England do not beat South Africa and then Fiji, Argentina and Australia this autumn, then there should be an outcry. England have never won all four autumn internationals.But, with both South Africa and Australia being as poor as in living memory, there will surely never be a better chance of a clean sweep.
