HHP, or Jabba as he is affectionately known, has had a rollercoaster last few months.In April, the star revealed that he had tried to commit suicide at least three times last year. He later booked himself into rehab to detox himself from antidepressants. To add to the pain, HHP's hardrive with all his "life's works" was stolen from his home.And the events of the recent past has left Cassper concerned. Speaking to DJ Fresh on 5FM on Monday, Cassper said that he tried to reach out to HHP and offer his support but has not heard from his idol."Jabba is just going through a lot at the moment. I haven't spoken to him. I tried to call him numerous times and I never get to speak to him. I tried but it's very difficult to help when someone is blocking you out or you can't reach them. I definitely think we have a responsibility as friends and fellow musicians to protect each other instead of going on Twitter and mocking. But like I said, when I get the chance I try to halla at him because clearly he is going through something," Cassper said.HHP previously questioned Cassper's lifestyle however the rapper shot down speculation that there's beef between them. Cassper also said that fans shouldn't read too much into the fact that his idol won't be performing at his Fill Up Orlando Stadium concert this weekend, just like he didn't perform at his historic Fill Up the Dome last year."I don't think that it's that much of a big deal. We're family. We're way past little squabbles. I mean, that is my brother. There is nothing that would not make us get along. I'm telling you, the day I see Jabba we are going to catch up and move on (with life)," he added. </img> Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
