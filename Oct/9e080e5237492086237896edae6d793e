News that the cooperative governance minister was making a fresh attempt to stop the report emerged on Monday morning a day after the Sunday Times reported that Van Rooyen had visited the Gupta family seven times prior to his being temporarily being installed as the country s finance minster last year.In his papers Van Rooyen s lawyers said that the video footage must have been obtained illegally and he claimed he was not made aware of its existence by the former public protector.He dropped his previous application to halt the report saying there were no adverse findings against him in it. President Jacob Zuma s application to stop the release of the report is to be held in the High Court on Pretoria on Tuesday.Earlier this month the BBC reported that the damning cellphone evidence is a key part of Madonsela s investigation into so-called state capture which President Jacob Zuma is trying to suppress .That BBC story emerged as Van Rooyen the finance minster for five days in December before being replaced by current incumbent Pravin Gordhan after a market collapse had first approached the North Gauteng High Court to get an interdict preventing Madonsela issuing her findings.The report said sources close to Madonsela say evidence gathered from cellphones show that the man chosen to succeed a popular finance minister who was dramatically sacked last year had spent the previous evening at the home of the Guptas a wealthy Indian business family alleged to wield influence over the president .The BBC report went on to say recordings allegedly reveal that the night before Nene was sacked last December the man who was selected to succeed him was drinking tea with the Guptas at their home in Johannesburg .After four opposition parties approached the court to oppose Van Rooyen s move Judge Dawie Fourie suggested the matter be stood down until next week so it could be heard with Zuma s application.The Democratic Alliance on Sunday said it will report Van Rooyen for misleading Parliament as he had in an answer to the National Assembly denied visiting the Gupta s compound in Saxonwold in the run up to his disastrous appointment as finance minister . Yet reports today indicate that van Rooyen met with the Gupta s at their residence not once but seven times the party said. TMG Digital
