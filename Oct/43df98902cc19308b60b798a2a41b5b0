Parliament has re-advertised the post of civilian watchdog for state security structures, which operated without this constitutional oversight since March 2015. R2K spokesman Murray Hunter said this came only after its attorneys, the Legal Resources Centre, told parliament further delays could result in urgent court action.R2K has shed light on what it calls intelligence scandals of journalists, activists and unions having their cellphones tapped and movements monitored.Hunter said: "We have seen from our past how dangerous it is to have intelligence agencies that are not subject to proper oversight. When there is a lack of oversight, we see increasing concerns that intelligence agencies subject people to illegal surveillance."The group asked parliament to make the appointment through a public process as with the public protector. Candidates have until Friday to apply.
