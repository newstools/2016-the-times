The campaign was aimed at sensitising educating and warning public servants about the dangers of corruption and how the Hawks will pounce on them if they are found to be on the wrong side of the law said Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso.During the campaign the Hawks outlined statistics revealing that a high number of government officials were being arrested and losing their jobs for corruption. [A police officer] was arrested for theft of exhibit money worth R45 000 and was served the highest fine of R100 000 or 5 years imprisonment the Hawks said. As the Hawks our aim is to curb fraud and corruption within government and private sector and in so doing get that much closer to having a province and a country that boasts the most reputable government officials.
