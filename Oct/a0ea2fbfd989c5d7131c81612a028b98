Workers at the mortuary who have been on strike for the past two days assured Dhlomo after a meeting on Wednesday that they would resume their duties on Thursday.The entire workforce downed tools because their manager who had been on suspension resumed her duties on Monday.Dhlomo intervened after receiving complaints from relatives indicating that the strike was bound to affect post mortem and burial schedules.Last year a family frustrated by the same mortuary took a corpse to the SABC in effort to get urgent help after they received a wrong body for burial. MEC Dhlomo informed the workers that he has not been told that matters pertaining to the manager s suspension have been concluded. About the manager s conduct he cited an incident where he had to personally intervene when employees at the facility under the manager s guidance had refused to assist a family that had earlier identified and took the wrong corpse for burial the MEC s office said in a statement.In calling for her suspension then Dhlomo had said: We really cannot keep a person without empathy in such a sensitive environment. Here we need people who will appreciate that even the departed have a right to dignity. We simply cannot keep a manager who fails to show leadership and cannot take decisive action to resolve challenges. The staff at the mortuary earlier told the MEC of other grievances that included issues of overtime and complaints about inadequate supply of protective clothing.As Dhlomo was leaving the mortuary the suspended manager arrived at the facility s gates. She was met by the MEC who told her that she must remain at home until she produces a letter that says her suspension has been reversed.
