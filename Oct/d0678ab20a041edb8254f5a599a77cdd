My son is the one who keep bringing Trevor Noah. 'Daddy, you must watch this.' Then he goes on Youtube and all those types of things."So, after catching a glimpse of the skits, Julius maintains that Trevor isn't doing a great job."I realise I am a very difficult person to imitate. Even Trevor is not succeeding. He's not winning." Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
