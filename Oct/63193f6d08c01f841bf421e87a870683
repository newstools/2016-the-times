In written reply to questions from questions from DA MP and police committee member Zakhele Mbhele Nhleko said the costs were related to motions regarding McBride s suspension and review proceedings thereof.The Constitutional Court ruled that the provisions with which Nhleko suspended McBride were unconstitutional and made provision for Parliament to be incorporated into the process of suspending the Ipid head in line with the Ipid Act.McBride returned to his office recently after about a year and a half away on suspension. The suspension was over his conduct where it pertained to a report into the rendition of Zimbabwe nationals in 2010 a matter that saw former Hawks head Anwa Drama removed. Robert McBride initiated the litigation against the minister challenging the provisions of the Ipid Act relating to suspension and removal of the Ipid Head said Nhleko.Nhleko also said a motion with regards to the suspension of Dramat also took the ministry back by R828 943. The suspension of former Gauteng provincial Hawks head Shadrack Sibiya cost the department R6.3-millon he said. Helen Suzman Foundation for Anwa Dramat took the Minister of Police to court and the Minister incurred the following costs as a result of litigation initiated against him. Shadrack Sibiya (also) challenged the decision to suspend him in court said Nhleko.Nhleko also mentioned the court challenge by KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Johan Booysen against his suspension which cost the department over R2.8-million.
