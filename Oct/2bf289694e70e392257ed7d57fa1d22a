So despite what you know is right, you decide to go the opposite route. More power to you," another added.And while others defended the couple, Samkelo took to Instagram on Monday to give haters a piece of her mind."Yesterday I spent the day celebrating two people's union in love. I was disappointed to find that in 2016; people are still homophobic and use religion and their opinion of what is right and wrong to push their agenda. It used to make me a bit mad that human beings stand in the way of other humans who just want to love each other. Now it just makes me sad," Samkelo wrote.She added that she believed that "God was present" at the ceremony. "God was present. Family was present and so was a priest and us as celebratory witnesses. But people still found dirt in a snow storm. I had the bible thrown at me and also loud mouths who just threw stones. Love was never based on religion, race, gender or age. Empty vessels make the loudest noise. Love is love. Who are you to decide? " she added. Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
