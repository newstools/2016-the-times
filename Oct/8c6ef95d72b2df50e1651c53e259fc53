All eyes will be on early bookmakers' favourite Rabada (7-2), now in the care of Brett Crawford. Rabada has his first run back after a successful KwaZulu-Natal season and on paper looks the one to beat. The only negative is draw No 17, which will come in three places if the reserve runners get scratched. The main dangers could be New Predator, Mac de Lago and Champagne Haze. Bulleting Home may be the value at this stage (14-1), with Piere Strydom taking the ride from a good draw of No 6.There is also the R2.5-million Emperors Palace Ready To Run Cup to look forward to on the same day.
