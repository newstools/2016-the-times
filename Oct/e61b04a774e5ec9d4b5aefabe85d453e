This follows a brawl at a council meeting on Thursday in which two other councillors were injured and taken to hospital.Lungisa was identified by investigators through cellphone video footage as the man who hit Democratic Alliance councillor Rano Kayser over the head with a glass water jug during the meeting on Thursday afternoon.It was reliably learnt on Sunday that Lungisa and Ward 19 councillor Gamalihleli Maqula were contacted by police and told to turn themselves in.However Maqula is believed to have told police he was out of town.Conflicting statements from councillors and other witnesses have stalled the investigation forcing police to rely on video footage to determine exactly what had transpired.
