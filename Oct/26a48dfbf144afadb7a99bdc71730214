The Light Aircraft Association has rescinded the award of a trophy to Tracey Curtis-Taylor for flying from Cape Town to Britain.Curtis-Taylor, who is a close friend of Prince Michael of Kent, has made a career of flying vintage planes around the world.But the 54-year-old was unceremoniously stripped of the Bill Woodhams Trophy during the association's annual general meeting at the weekend.Members of the group claimed that she misled the public and voted for her to be stripped of the trophy by a majority of nearly two to one.It is thought to be the first time such an award has been withdrawn.Curtis-Taylor, who attended the meeting in an attempt to head off the motion, has been mired in controversy after flight instructor Ewald Gritsch came forward to say that he had been in the forward cockpit of her vintage biplane for most of her "solo" journeys.Speaking in the wake of the disclosure, Curtis-Taylor previously said: "For the avoidance of doubt, I have always been the sole pilot."She later said she had never claimed to be flying solo and insisted that Austrian Gritsch had merely been a passenger.However, her logistics manager, Sam Rutherford, said the airman gave her vital flight instructions and helped with engineering.He also accused her of embellishing the truth and said she had flown only four of the 36 legs from Cape Town to Goodwood on her own.Barry Tempest, a veteran member of the Light Aircraft Association, who suggested that her award be withdrawn, said: "I am delighted that the award has been rescinded and her name will removed from the annals of the association."I have the greatest of respect for women pilots but I think Tracey Curtis-Taylor is a boastful lady who needs bringing down a peg or two."She made these claims about flying solo, or at least that is what we were led to believe, and now it has come out that they were not that at all. Far from it. "Curtis-Taylor completed the 16000km flight in 2013 and received the award from the association last year as a result.Speaking in 2013, Curtis-Taylor recounted how her ground crew had to endure threats of kidnapping, airdrops from military cargo planes, bribery and the arrest of a contractor paid to deliver fuel during a three-week journey to deliver a biplane to South Africa.The association said it would respect the vote of its members.CE Steve Slater said: "This issue has divided opinion but it is not for me to decide."I am happy that the members feel able to air their views and it's down to them to decide."
