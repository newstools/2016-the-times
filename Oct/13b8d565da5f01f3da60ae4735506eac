Details of his death were not immediately available.Couzens who was employed in the Graduate School for Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand won a number of awards for his works.In a statement on Thursday the Nelson Mandela Foundation said: Professor Tim Couzens was a colleague and a friend to many of us at the Nelson Mandela Foundation. We are devastated at his passing. We spent many months working closely with Tim on Nelson Mandela s international best-selling book Conversations with Myself. As the lead writer on the book Tim spent many hours at a time working in our archives with Madiba s private papers. It was Tim who conceived of the style of the book after Meditations by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. We will miss Tim s wisdom which he shared generously but with great humility. Most of all we will miss his wicked sense of humour. I will never forget how whenever you paid Tim a compliment he would downplay it and instead turn it around to make you look good said Sello Hatang Chief Executive of the Nelson Mandela Foundation. Our deepest condolences go to his wife Diana Wall and the family as well as his legion of friends fans and reading public all over the world.
