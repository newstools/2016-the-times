According to a statement shared by West Ink record label owner Mampintsha on Instagram, the Wololo hitmaker is seeking to "create and address awareness" against the use of drugs amongst the South African youth."We will be sending you details of the campaign soon and we urge and pledge government as well as private stake holders to lend their support to our cause," the statement reads.This upcoming campaign comes in the wake of a press statement released by The Congress of South African Students (COSAS) calling on Babes to publicly condemn the use of drugs and underage drinking.In the statement, COSAS explained that Babes' latest track is the same name of a 'killer drug' that has seen many young people in KwaMashu and surrounding townships land in hospital due to a drug overdose.However, Babes camp has, once again, slammed the accusations, saying the song has always been about the singer's favourite car."It is very sad that Babes favourite car happens to share the same pseudonym as the dangerous drug but we would like to re affirm our truth to you all that the song has always been about a car, which is also the same dream car that her own father has always wanted to own but was never able to afford."The story of the song is thus a continuation of a young black girl who grew up in the ghetto and literally came from nothing to being what she is today and is just singing out her dreams in her songs. It is also a gravely unfortunate coincidence that we overlooked the possibility of the song being linked to the drug of the same name but we empathize with everyone who has been affected by this."
