Police cordoned off several roads leading to parliament and commuters were caught up in early afternoon gridlock.The peaceful protest turned violent at 3pm.ffsWhile rubber bullets stun grenades and rocks flew during sporadic clashes in parts of the city TMG Digital asked some of the protesters which included university workers and parents - for their perspective on the march.Ethel Rondile a cleaner at the University of Cape Town supported the #FeesMustFall demands because she said workers wanted the institution to employ them permanently."These are our children it is a pity that the government we voted for that of Jacob Zuma is nowhere to be seen " said Rondile."Instead of coming out and addressing the students they are sending police. They must demilitarise the campuses."Sindiswa Mbambo a security guard at UCT echoed her sentiments."We want the university to employ us. When we are permanently employed we will get benefits such as medical aid and our children will study for free " she said.UCT student Lukhanyo Vanqa said: "We are on the right side of history". He added: "We must use violence violence gives us power."Social media was awash with images of the aftermath of the march.studentsSullivan Photography said in a tweet: Current situation in Cape Town CBD. #FeesMustFall #uct #cput #uwc #fees2017 Current situation in Cape Town CBD. #FeesMustFall #uct #cput #uwc #fees2017 pic.twitter.com/L7YpUuiZY8 Sullivan Photography (@Sullphotography) October 26, 2016 Current situation in Cape Town CBD. #FeesMustFall #uct #cput #uwc #fees2017 pic.twitter.com/L7YpUuiZY8Journalist Tshego posted an image of smashed windows at a fast food outlet in the city.
