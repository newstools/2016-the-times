The pair met while filming the movie Sarafina. Back then Mbongeni was a married man but it did not stop him from having an affair with Leleti, before getting married in 1992.And after 14 years of marriage, the two went their own separate ways.Speaking to True Love magazine, Leleti spilled the beans on her failed marriage, in which she alleged that it was abusive. While most victims of abuse find it hard to leave the relationship, Leleti, on the contrary, claimed that wasn't the case with her."Leaving Ngema wasn t difficult because my mind was made up. I wanted out," she told the local publication.Similarly, in a candid interview on e.tv's The Close Up with Nicky Greenwall, the actress revealed details about the unhappy life she was living behind closed doors."I wasn t living a normal life. I wasn t allowed to go anywhere I wanted to," she said."I wanted to do different plays, but it wasn t possible. I don t know if I could say he was jealous of me, I don t know."And when she could not take it anymore, she announced that she would be filing for divorce."I woke up one morning. I don t know what sparked it. I released a statement that we were divorcing."
