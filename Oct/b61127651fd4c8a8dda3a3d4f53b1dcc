While giving his first lecture at the Red Bull Music Academy in Montr al, Canada, Black Coffee held nothing back as he opened up about his upbringing a township, and the living conditions there.He revealed that townships, "a system that was created for black people," are places where people emulate what is in front of them, and subsequently become "comfortable.""No one aspires to be anything," he said.Black Coffee explained that despite the fact that apartheid has ended, black people still face a struggle of mentally getting out of that uninspiring system."Our biggest struggle till today is getting out of that system. It is the most imprisoning system to be in, because it's not just about walking out of it."People get comfortable to the point that they love it and so even when they make it in life, they will spend most of their days living in the township, going to hang out the same way the people before them did and eventually they end up back in the township because it is such a toxic place."Black Coffee insisted that he was aware of the need to move away from his village as a young boy and would often wish upon a shooting star to be able to be the best that he could be and make a change."I used to sit there, the whole day and imagine this life [of] travelling overseas, probably here [Montr al], not even knowing how to pronounce this place. I had all these visions and dreams, wanting a better life, wanting to do something greater with my life, wanting to get out of that system, wanting to be the best."Watch the full Black Coffee lecture below: Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
