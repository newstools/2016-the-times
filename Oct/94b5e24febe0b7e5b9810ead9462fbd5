The group - which represents Khoisan communities - wants the court to force the government to acknowledge its loss of land and that the Khoisan Leadership Bill be scrapped.Academics have argued that it did not allow for self affiliation and free choice membership of traditional communities, with the Bill apparently seeking to reinstate bantustan communities.George Gangerdine, from the Pioneer Council, which deals with issues relating to the people of Griqualand, said it supported the advocacy group's Constitutional Court efforts.The group wants to be recognised as South Africa's original inhabitants and past atrocities committed by Dutch and British settlers acknowledged as genocide.In its court papers, the group states: "We as the Khoisan community are collectively labelled as 'coloured', and continue to experience unjust discrimination, first by the colonial invasion, then the apartheid-era rule."Currently [we are] suppressed into conforming to the past immoral identity under the authority of a democratic government, who refuse to correct the injustice of colonial racial identification."The government will oppose the matter.
