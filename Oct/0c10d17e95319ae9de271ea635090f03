The crowd went mad and social media followed soon after.So Future just opened for Nasty C?! #HelloAfrica #MTVMAMA2016 Boity Thulo (@Boity) October 22, 2016Future basically just opened for Nasty C right there #MAMAs #MTVMAMA2016 Maps Maponyane (@MapsMaponyane) October 22, 201So Future just opened for Nasty C?! #HelloAfrica #MTVMAMA2016Future basically just opened for Nasty C right there #MAMAs #MTVMAMA2016Sol and Khanya: Cassper cuts his ponytail &amp; sets the stage alight Cassper took to the MAMAs red carpet on Saturday night looking smart in a tux. But something was different with Cass. The star had decided to cut his trademark ponytail, saying that it was time to grow up."I'm growing up bro, my brand is growing up. I'm a CEO now. It's time for me to boss up and clean up," Cassper told TshisaLIVE.The decison had fans talking for much of the night, until he shut them all up with a killer live performance of his latest hit 2 Legit. No wonder the star won a MAMA for Best Live Act!Cassper Cut his Ponytail , something that worked for him. Yet wena u cant even cut the people holding you back out of your life....

Somizi had a highly-publicised fall out with MAMAs host Bonang Matheba earlier this year. He paid tribute to her in a speech filled with jokes and mimics. It was so spicy that fans (and celebs) couldn't help but share their surprise.SOMIZI!!!!! #MAMAs #MTVMAMA2016 Maps Maponyane (@MapsMaponyane) October 22, 2016Somizi leratokganyago (@leratokganyago) October 22, 2016SOMIZI!!!!! #MAMAs #MTVMAMA2016Somizi Lerato Kganyago: Mandoza's tributeOne of the more sobering moments of the awards was a touching tribute to the late kwaito legend Mandoza. The tribute by Trompies, DJ Cleo and Mdu Masilela, had fans on their feet and in tears. It was a gentle and kind reminder of the giant we lost.That tribute is going to be amazeballs... Uncle Bae is also there lol https://t.co/lJ0tQFrJiY leratokganyago (@leratokganyago) October 22, 2016That tribute is going to be amazeballs... Uncle Bae is also there lol https://t.co/lJ0tQFrJiYCouldn't have chosen better ppl to do the Mandoza tribute RIP #MTVMAMA2016 lee (@ThickLeeyonce) October 22, 2016Couldn't have chosen better ppl to do the Mandoza tribute RIP #MTVMAMA2016Pearl Thusi: Caster wins goldAnd while there may have been cheers and applause for all of the moments listed above, perhaps the longest and loudest was for Olympic gold medallist Caster Semenya. The athlete may be a big fan of hip-hop but she wasn't at the awards for her sharp emceeing skills. Instead, the star walked away with the Personality of the Year award. The crowd (and country) couldn't help but cheer her on every single time she opened her mouth!Constant screams for @caster800m as she celebrates her personality of the year award #MTVMAMA2016 pic.twitter.com/74fg2JITPs TshisaLIVE (@TshisaLIVE) October 22, 2016CONGRATULATIONS @caster800m !!!!!
