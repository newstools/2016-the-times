The Soweto derby tends to throw up unexpected results and tomorrow's league clash at FNB Stadium might not be any different.Going on results, Chiefs deserve the favourites tag, having won five matches on the trot, and they are top of the log with 13 points from six matches.Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela knows the run is an important one, but does not want his squad to be too comfortable."We appreciate the run. We are getting results, but we have to be careful. You don't go there cocky, or you'll get hurt," he said."I don't want the team to be familiar with the current situation because familiarity breeds complacency, which breeds mediocrity."We are treating this game like any other without the results we have achieved so far.""Basically, it's a principle of nature and energy that if you are too tense you won't perform," said Komphela."Tension is created by talk around an issue. So, less talk, more energy. But whether you like it or not, when the players wake up on match day, when they pull the curtain open, reality strikes. "When you drive to the stadium, as you get on the field for the warm-up, you feel the energy. One way or another it does get back to you. But it is important for athletes and sports professionals to have anxiety and not fear," he said."When you write an exam you need anxiety, because if you don't you will be complacent and fail."
