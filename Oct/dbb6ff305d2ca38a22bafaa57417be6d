Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union spokesman Richard Mamabolo said all members in their provinces - during their provincial executive committee meetings - have affirmed their support for the campaign."Most police officers know for a fact that on salaries they earn they would not be able to take their children through tertiary education. They cannot even afford to buy bonded houses. The struggle of students is fully supported by members."Mamabolo said police clashes with students is as a result of few elements who were bent on destroying property.He said police action during violent protests were meant to protect protesters."Police are required to act when any protest becomes violent and there is no contradiction there."Police support the students' campaign but they do not support acts of violence " he said.Mamabolo said Poprcu is of the view that the campaign has been hijacked by rogue elements.He called on parents to join the struggle of the students and isolate criminal elements which have infiltrated the campaign.Popcru is a majority union which organises within the police and correctional services.Acting national commissioner of the South African Police Service Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane said on Friday that police officials were being targeted."It is a pity that some police officials have been targeted via e-mails social media and other means because they represent security and order " he said."This form of intimidation will never succeed."Lt-Gen Phahlane added: "The SAPS remains operationally ready to police all planned protest actions to ensure that they remain peaceful and that the democratic rights of others are not trampled upon in the process."He was speaking at the conclusion of a three-day SAPS National Management Forum meeting which is aimed at promoting cooperation and coordination in the Service. The forum ensures the deputy national commissioners provincial divisional and regional commissioners are actively involved in decision-making processes that determine the strategic direction of the service and the National Commissioner is fully informed of developments in the provinces and divisions.
