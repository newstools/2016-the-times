They entered the dingy establishment with its smoky rabbit warren of rooms and passages, but missed the mother lode, that was hastily carried out the back exit before the officers could get there.Houghton and his men weren't raiding an Eldorado Park lolly lounge or a crack den. This was an opium den on Main Street, Johannesburg, and they were fighting the city's first drug epidemic.Houghton's colourful account of the raid that occurred in Joburg's Chinese quarter happened in 1905 and it was relatively successful. Despite the 500 pounds [226kg] of opium that slipped out the back door into Fox Street, the police found drugs and arrested three "Chinamen" who were given a penalty of 75 or three months at hard labour.Police today can easily relate to what Houghton experienced 111 years ago and it is a reminder that as Joburg turned 130 this month, its war on drugs dates way back before the arrival of Mandrax, cocaine or nyaope.Like future drug wars, the police and customs officials back then weren't winning this one. Opium was coming in by the ton.Historian Thembisa Waetjen writes how the drug was found hidden in consignments of bananas or bags of cement.The users were the tens of thousands of indentured Chinese miners who had been brought out as cheap labour to kick-start the gold-mining industry after the Anglo Boer War.They began arriving in the country in 1904.Historian Charles van Onslen said a high percentage of the Chinese were addicts."A quarter of them were pissed or on opium," said Van Onslen.Between 1905 and 1906, said Waetjen, 13% of Chinese miner deaths were attributed to opium overdoses - second only to mine accidents at 32%.Getting the opium to the Reef was a drug network as complex as any today. To launder the contraband, opium was often smuggled from the East into Europe first.Opium would then be shipped from Liverpool or Hamburg, en route to Johannesburg."Today the direct flight from San Paulo, Brazil, to OR Tambo generates a lot of interest from customs officials because it's a main cocaine route into the country."But a flight from Sydney to South Africa wouldn't have the same interest," said Van Onselen, explaining that's why opium would be sent through Europe.Many of the drug dealers bringing in the opium were chemists, who would pass it on to middlemen - some Chinese traders - who would smuggle opium into the mining compounds.The authorities had to act. Although mine bosses were worried about the effects on productivity, legislators were concerned that the narcotic would escape the confines of the compounds and spread to the city.Laws were passed that controlled the amount of opium chemists could hold.But it wasn't legislation and the efforts of customs officer Houghton were not enough to win this first battle in Joburg's war on drugs.The great opium scare of the early 1900s ended when the last of the Chinese miners were sent home. Opium did make it out of the mine compounds, said Van Onselen, but it found few takers.One of them was Afrikaner writer and morphine addict Eugene Marais, who moved from Pretoria to Johannesburg to get closer to the supply of his favourite narcotic.Later he would have to rely on an Indian trader to source opium when he couldn't find morphine.Soon the opium dens of Ferreirasdorp, Braamfontein and the Chinese quarter would fade away. Joburg would have to wait until deep into the 20th century to see the next wave of narcotics, smuggled in by international crime syndicates. There would be cocaine in the early 1990s, thanks to opening borders in a post-apartheid South Africa. Then there would be tik and then opium would be back. This time in its refined form of cheap heroin, the basis of nyaope.
