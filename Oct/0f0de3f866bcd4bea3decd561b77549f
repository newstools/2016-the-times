Emam who won 86 caps for Egypt and played for 10 seasons at Zamalek as well as in the Italian Serie A with Udinese says Sundowns will crumble under the pressure if the White Knights can make a fast start to the game. Any African team that plays in Egypt collapses after conceding an early goal in the first 10 minutes of the game due to pressure from the fans attending the match Emam told Sada El Balad TV. Final matches don t require talking about plans and tactics. They re about players playing with spirit.

It s a tough mission but not impossible. We [Zamalek] need to play it smart and in the right way without creating any gaps on the pitch because conceding a goal would end Zamalek s hopes he said. The midfielders must support the three defenders. The offense doesn t require many technical abilities because the basics of football are not taught in the final. Each player should concentrate and perform in his position. Sundowns defense line is their weakest link and we need to take advantage of this through passes from Ayman Hefny and movements of Bassem Morsy and Stanley [Ohawuchi]. Sundowns claimed victory in the first leg thanks to strikes from Anthony Laffor and Tebogo Langerman as well as an own goal from Islam Gamal.They are seeking to become the first South African side to win the Champions League competition since Orlando Pirates in 1995.This is the second time they are appearing in the final. They drew 1-1 with Ahly in the home leg of the 2001 decider before losing 3-0 in Cairo in the return leg a scoreline they need to avoid on Sunday. - TMG Digital
