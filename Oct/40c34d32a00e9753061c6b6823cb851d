A letter was sent to Moyane on Tuesday concerning his failure to act decisively on the findings of the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) report detailing fraud and corruption by his deputy Jonas Makwakwa and his girlfriend Kelly-Ann Elskie.The FIC is a banking regulator and provided the report to Sars recommending investigations into whether R1.2-million in "suspicious and unusual" deposits into Makwakwa s account were proceeds of crime corruption or money laundering.Moyane has sat on the FIC report on Makwakwa since May and Sars last month said the FIC had not been co-operating.Makwakwa has been suspended over the allegations.Corruption Watch on Wednesday said it was disturbed by the manner in which Moyane handled the case and his failure to take appropriate action was unlawful as the commissioner was obliged to report Makwakwa and Elskie to the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation the Hawks. Failing to do this may result in imprisonment or a fine it said. We treat this in the most serious light Corruption Watch executive director David Lewis said. If the commissioner of our revenue collecting agency cannot be entrusted to act against corruption then who can? We are determined that the Hawks should act against him. Should the Hawks fail to do so the anti-corruption organisation said it would examine its legal options in relation to the responsible law enforcement agencies.It alleged that Moyane had also contravened the FIC Act when he notified Makwakwa and Elskie of the FIC report as the act prohibited the disclosure of suspicious and unusual transaction to certain persons particularly those implicated in the report. We will also lay criminal charges in respect of this contravention Corruption Watch said.The organisation has given Moyane the opportunity to respond to these issues by November 1.
