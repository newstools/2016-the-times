But that was one of the few nuggets of good news for the visitors who allowed their inexperienced opponents to score 435/8 in reply to their 489 perhaps because Dale Steyn and Kagiso Rabada did not bowl.At least Morne Morkel proved he is over the back injury that kept him out of the test series against New Zealand and the one-day rubber against Australia.Morkel who bowled only 22 balls in SA s first match of the tour last weekend got through 14 overs on Friday and struck twice in the last 10 overs of the game. He bowled some really quick spells throughout the day and you saw that spell with the second new ball left-arm spinner Maharaj who claimed 3/59 in 17.2 steady overs said about Morkel. He looked really really good. He looked 100 percent the Morne Morkel we know and hopefully he can carry that into the matches that follow. The flatness of the pitch is apparently what stopped SA from unleashing Steyn and Rabada and the same factor helped Tim Ludeman score 167. Proteas' coach Domingo keeps his job but new contract raises questions There were also half-centuries for Sam Raphael and Jake Winter while the home side enjoyed the stability of two century stands.SA sent eight bowlers into the fray including Dean Elgar and even Temba Bavuma.Doubtless SA s attack and their approach will be different in the first test at the WACA on Thursday. - TMG Digital Sport
