It seems like a very straightforward question but, my word, what a runaround the network gave me when I sought a definitive answer.In November last year an MTN spokesman told me - after I'd taken up the case of a subscriber who had "lost" his accumulated airtime minutes when he migrated to a cheaper MTN package - that MTN would be "amending its rules to make provision for customers to carry over balances when they upgrade and migrate and this will even cover migration from prepaid to postpaid".In August I asked MTN if the rules had in fact been amended, because I'd received a complaint from another MTN subscriber about an airtime forfeiture when he migrated from a post paid to a pre paid contract.That question wasn't answered.But the media office said it had responded and attached its response, which didn't answer the question at all.So I asked again.This time following up on the case of Lunga Kalashe, who wrote to me earlier this month to say that his two-year MTN contract was about to expire and, having elected to keep his handset and switch to prepaid, he'd been told that he'd have to use all his data and accumulated airtime within a week or lose it."The data is not even contractual [bundled value] - I bought it separately," he said. "Even if it was [a bundled benefit], it's still my money, I paid for it already at R499 a month - this is really ridiculous."And nowhere in my contact can I find a clause that says I will lose my airtime and data if I switch from contract to prepaid."On October 5, I e-mailed MTN's media office to ask: "Did the spokesman who told me about the policy review speak out of turn? Had the policy been changed as he had promised and then changed back again?"Are you able to produce Kalashe's contract and point out the clause that stipulates the airtime and data forfeiture on contract migration?"Two days later I was sent a statement from MTN SA's chief customer experience officer, Ideshini Naidoo."MTN has revised its carryover policy and now customers are allowed to carry over their [unused airtime] value when they migrate from pre paid to post paid."That begged my next question: "Does that mean when someone migrates from postpaid (contract) to prepaid, they are forced to sacrifice their accumulated "value"? Is unused value migrated only from prepaid to postpaid?"When I'd had no response six days later, I sent a reminder on e-mail.And the next day I got this: "Customers get to carry over their value even when they migrate from postpaid to prepaid."Finally, I have that on the record. Luckily, I don't give up easily.Clearly the next question was, if that is indeed MTN's policy, why was Kalashe told this month that he had to use his airtime and data before his switch to prepaid became effective or it would be "lost"?My promised response hadn't materialised when I wrote this, but Kalashe told me that MTN has since assured him that his data and airtime would be transferred to his prepaid SIM.As it should be.It's patently unfair for a subscriber to be forced to forfeit airtime or data they have paid for when they switch between packages within a network.When subscribers owe networks "value" they are hounded to pay up and if they don't they are handed over to collection agencies, and the interest and fees pile on.And, for extra punishment, there's a negative listing on their credit record.So it's patently unfair for a network to deny a subscriber the benefit of airtime and data they have paid for, when they remain loyal to the network but exercise their right to move to another package.Data and airtime costs are high enough in this country without being made to forfeit what we've already paid for.CONTACT WENDY:Email: consumer@knowler.co.zaTwitter: @wendyknowler DATA EXTENSIONOn the back of #datamustfall, there's a growing sentiment among South Africans that the practice of premature data "expiry" must fall.Putting a "use by" date of less than three years on any prepaid goods or services is a contravention of the Consumer Protection Act.But the networks do it routinely, and I've yet to hear a justification that makes any sense.A couple of decades ago the networks thought it was fair to charge people call rates to listen to their voice-mail messages.Imagine them trying to justify that today.Data expiry after a month or two or three - or anything less than three years - will continue until enough consumers say enough.#SHELFIE CONFUSED MUCH?
