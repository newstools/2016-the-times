Comparisons are often made between the two derbies in the two great cities Johannesburg and Cairo situated at the northern and southern extremities of Africa.The Soweto derby on Saturday afternoon between the two great South African rivals Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium is the highlight on the country's sports calendar.The hype surrounding Mamelodi Sundowns Caf Champions League final victory against Zamalek in the past two weeks to become SA s first African club champions since Pirates in 1995 might have taken some of normal hype from Saturday s derby.The stands might not be packed to capacity but they regularly are for the match-up between southern Africa s two biggest-supported sporting teams who both hail from the world s most famous township.Certainly a 94 000 crowd at FNB Stadium for Chiefs-Pirates can match the spectacle of any of the world s great football derbies or sports rivalries.But does it eclipse Al Ahly vs Zamalek as the biggest derby in Africa?For this reporter having now seen the awesome spectacle of both the great Cairo giants supporters not at the moment.This past weekend I witnessed the sheer noise generated by Zamalek s 65 000 supporters in Borg El Arab for Downs second leg defeat in Alexandria. In 2013 I saw Ahly s even louder 35 000 supporters at the Arab Contractors Stadium in Cairo against Orlando Pirates in the 2013 Champions League final.Having experienced the at once exhilarating and also bone-chillingly terrifying chanting in unison of both sets of fans separately one can only imagine the explosiveness of the occasion when the two come together for the Cairo derby at 80 000-seater Cairo International Stadium.Then there is the fact that Egyptian football has simply been around longer at international level and enjoyed greater sustained success than South Africa s.And just plain population statistics. Egypt has 100-million people and 40-million football supporters South Africa 50-million and 20-million half on both counts.Pirates two continental club finals in the past three years and Downs victory this year though point to early signs of a tentative shift in power from north to south.Certainly the standard of the ever-improving Premier Soccer League its world-class stadiums its professionally-run teams such as Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United and its exciting finishes are attracting increasing attention across Africa.The Soweto derby pips its Cairo rival for attendance at monstrous World Cup final venue FNB Stadium. And SA fans might not be as vocal or fanatical as those in Egypt but they are no less passionate.More laid back and friendly the manner in which Pirates and Chiefs fans sit together in FNB not having to be separated by security must be unique in a major derby worldwide and creates its own festival atmosphere.For now though Ala Ahly v Zamalek must surely be the No.1 derby on the continent with its Soweto counterpart hot on its heels.TMG Digital
