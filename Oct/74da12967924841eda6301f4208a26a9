Ningazos'dina (Don't p*ss me off)! Report it again, ngizokuLoya (and I will bewitch you)," she wrote in one caption.Her anger was shared by Candy, who took to the comments section of a post to accuse the people who reported the image of being sour and jealous."I think the person who reported never had an opportunity to see her or his own girl child (have this ceremony because they) were sleeping around. So now for them to see the girl who was well groomed and respected loving herself so much, it's killing them deeply. We love you and South Africa loves you, Ntando and Thando " Candy wrote.Thando's Instagram account has been deactived since she posted pictures of the ceremony. It is not known if she herself removed the account or if it was reported. </img> Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
