I am now home but it will take time to fully recover as my major organs the lungs kidneys and heart had collapsed."I will take it step by step and do regular checks ups said Tovey through a statement from Safa. I would like to thank everybody the South African public my family and the hospital staff; I feel touched and humbled. Tovey watched the highlights of Mamelodi Sundowns African Champions League victory from the comfort of his home and wished the Pretoria side well. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Sundowns for becoming champions of Africa."They lifted the spirits of all South Africans. Job well done and once again congrats he said. - TMG Digital
