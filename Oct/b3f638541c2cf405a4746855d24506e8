They were joined by about 40 workers from the university who vowed to shut down the institution saying that although some had been insourced their shifts had been reduced and they now earned R4 000 a month. They were demanding longer working shifts and R12 500 a month plus additional medical aid benefits.Taking the security guards by surprise some of the protesters broke away from the group and attacked a lone security guard.Video footage of the incident shows the guard lying on the ground being beaten with a steel rod taped up with masking tape. He is also beaten with his own baton.
