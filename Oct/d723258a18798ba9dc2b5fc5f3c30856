Austin Coetsee, a 64-year-old Kenilworth man, was unaware that his marriage had deteriorated to the point that his wife, Potina, 44, allegedly wanted him dead.Potina Coetsee was arrested on Tuesday at the Lansdowne railway station in a sting operation by members of the provincial detective and the Manenberg serious and violent crimes investigation units.She had reportedly handed over cash, said to be about R200,000, to men whom she allegedly believed would have her husband assassinated.Family attorney Geoff Carter said Austin was traumatised but was focusing on caring for the couple's two minor children. They are still living in the family home. "As far as I am concerned, they had a very good marriage," said Carter.He said he had met the couple earlier this year and was not aware that their relationship was strained.Potina Coetsee appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court yesterday to apply for bail.The businesswoman is facing charges of conspiracy to murder.The state told the court that it was still assessing whether she was a flight risk.The case was postponed to next week.
