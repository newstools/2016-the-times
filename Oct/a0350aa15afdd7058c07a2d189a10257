Mayor Patricia de Lille said yesterday that the city had applied to the Pretoria High Court to recover the R429.4-million she said the companies owed it. This follows reports that no provision was made in the settlement between the government and the companies for municipalities to get compensation. Municipalities allegedly lost about R112-billion as a result of the collusion.De Lille accused the commission that investigated the collusion of being too lenient."This resolution taken by the presidential infrastructure co-ordinating commission has allowed construction companies to get away with serious corruption scot-free," said De Lille."[This is] a complete lack of accountability, which is being wholly endorsed by Minister [of Rural Development and Land Reform Gugile] Nkwinti as the chairman of the commission."The only punishment these massive companies face is the creation of a R1.5-billion slush fund, which they are now coerced into contributing towards and which is supposed to further transformation.""The construction industry should be prioritising transformation. It is ridiculous that ratepayers' money is being used to help them diversify. Residents are paying for the crimes and failures of construction companies."The application will be heard in court on December 2.
