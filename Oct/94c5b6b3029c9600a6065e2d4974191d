The former deputy chief justice, who retired five months ago after 15 years on the Constitutional Court bench, has been appointed chairman of the Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra."The most appropriate way to celebrate his appointment," said Bongani Tembe, CE and artistic director of the Johannesburg and KwaZulu-Natal philharmonic orchestras, "is with music. To this end we will stage a joint orchestral concert - a very rare event."The concert will be at the Linder Auditorium in Johannesburg on Wednesday and Thursday.Tembe, who was appointed to lead the Johannesburg philharmonic in September last year, immediately augmented its board."We have assembled a board of with people who bring different talents to the table, such as Seth Phalatse, a director of BMW SA, Yolisa Phahle, CEO of M-Net, and IDC chairman Busi Mabuza."Tembe said the courting of the former justice took about three months. "We knew a man with his wisdom and integrity was the right person to chair the board . he will ensure good corporate governance and that we meet our objectives, including utilising the orchestra to brand Johannesburg positively, nationally and around the world."Moseneke said the arts were fundamental to the progress of a society."The arts are an effective tool for bringing people of all ages and races together," he said, adding that he aimed to fulfil one of the Johannesburg philharmonic's most important objectives: "to contribute meaningfully to the quality of life of all the people of Gauteng".When Moseneke was 15 he was sentenced to 10 years on Robben Island. His legal career spanned more than 40 years.No stranger to the power of music, Moseneke recalled the impression the musical King Kong made on him when he was 10.In his newly released book My Own Liberator he remembers going to the Wits Great Hall - one of the few public amenities that allowed racially mixed audiences - with his father to see King Kong, starring Miriam Makeba and pianist Todd Matshikiza.He also recounts in the book the effect on him of the music made by prisoners on Robben Island, notably trumpeter Gabby Magomola, who "would infuse so much passion into his rendition of Hamba Kahle that our hearts would be full".
