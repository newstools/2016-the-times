The finance minister who has recently been charged with fraud - is set to deliver his Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement in Parliament on Wednesday.There has been widespread support for Gordhan in recent weeks as he faces political upheaval.And his classmates from Sastri College a former all-Indian boys school have expressed unwavering confidence in the very quiet boy with whom they matriculated in 1967.Medical doctor Dawood Bobat s message to Gordhan read: Dear Pravin. You are now at the crossroad of your political career. Looking back to our high school days I vividly remember your passion to speak for the downtrodden and the exploitation of the capitalist system. Sadly our comrades have a different spin on this matter. If you had been an MP in Britain I am sure you would have received a knighthood. Another classmate lawyer Anand Jayrajh said Sastri College alumni felt that the minister is being unduly prejudiced . He plays a very very important role in our country especially in the way that he manages our economy. We are of the strong view that he should stop being harassed said Jayrajh.In a statement this month Sastri College alumni expressed disgust at the police and the prosecution s indecisiveness over the matter and for causing Gordhan trauma and anxiety . The former pupils hinted at a staged assault to the minister s integrity reputation and even his educational qualifications . We appeal to those who have hidden purposes in their pursuit of Minister Gordhan to desist from their underhand stratagems among these being the use of the media to continue the assault in a cowardly and unacceptable manner the statement reads.Gordhan who attained a BPharm at the University of Durban Westville at one stage campaigned for the ANC door-to-door.He will appear in court on November 2. - TMG Digital/The Times
