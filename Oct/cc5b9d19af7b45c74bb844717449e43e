It's not necessarily the case that tickets are cheaper the earlier you book, and with no hard and fast rule it is difficult to tell.Now a new feature from Google's flight-searching tool has taken the hassle out of picking the best time to book flights.The search engine will now tell you when the price of a flight is expected to rise, or allow you to track flights by e-mail to see how they fluctuate.The service is a new feature of Google Flights, the search engine's own price comparison tool that rivals Skyscanner and Kayak.When selecting a route, the search results may display a notification saying when prices may rise, based on historical flight data.Tapping the notification button will give you details about how likely the price rise is and by how much it will be.When selecting a particular flight, Google will tell you in how many hours the fare is likely to increase.For example, above the button to proceed there may be a notification saying " 71 (about R1250) fare increase likely in eight hours".The service is most useful for monitoring price rises when buying tickets in the weeks running up to flights.But if you're looking at tickets several months in advance, you can also set up e-mail notifications that will alert you when prices are expected to increase, or when they actually increase or decrease.The feature puts Google in competition with Hopper, a mobile app that shows users the best time to purchase a ticket.The US company says the feature will become available in the coming weeks.
