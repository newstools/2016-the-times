This comes in the wake of reports last week that there was a chance that 7de Laan would be shutting down at the beginning of this week due to a deep financial crisis.Muvhango reportedly faced a similar problem. The show's creator Duma Ndlovu told Sunday World earlier this month that production was halted after staff were instructed not to go to work, because there was no money to pay them and a contract with the SABC had not been renewed.However, it has since been revealed that the SABC finally renewed its contract with Danie Odendaal Productions (which produces 7de Laan) .But uncertainty looms for other productions, including Muvhango, as contracts are still in the process of being finalised.On why contracts are taking long to be renewed, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago explained to TshisaLIVE that getting both parties (the public broadcaster and production companies) to reach a contractual agreement is often a lengthy and complex process."We deal with thousands of contracts on a month-to-month basis, and we have to be meticulous with each one of them to ensure that we and the respective production companies are happy with the agreement, and that takes some time," he said, before pointing out that viewers should not be worried about their favourite shows coming to a halt."It is not to say we are not going to sign the contracts. All contracts that we receive are being renegotiated, so there is no need to panic."He added that when production companies run out of funds, it is not the SABC's fault, because they are not responsible for how the different shows spend the money that they receive from the public broadcaster."It paints a picture of how production companies manage their finances," he said.
