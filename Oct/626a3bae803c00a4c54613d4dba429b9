Zwane said in a statement he had not been given a chance to answer any allegations against him that may be contained in the report adding that the Protector "cannot confirm or deny" if the report makes adverse findings against him - similar grounds to Van Rooyen.Zwane in September announced that Cabinet had decided to investigate the conduct of banks that had closed accounts belonging to Gupta family businesses and that it would also hold banking regulators to account for the decision. He later modified those remarks, insisting he wasn't speaking on behalf of Cabinet but in his capacity as chairperson of the interministerial committee.Van Rooyen originally sought to interdict the report but withdrew his application because he said the report did not implicate him. In the latest application, Van Rooyen seeks an order setting aside the report insofar as it implicated him directly or indirectly or created and inference concerning him.His application follows a report in the Sunday Times in which Van Rooyen is alleged to have visited the Gupta family seven times in the days before he was appointed as finance minister in December last year.The High Court in Pretoria is scheduled to hear an application by President Jacob Zuma to stop the release of the report on Tuesday. However Zuma has applied for the matter to be postponed because of an application by former African National Congress MP Vytjie Mentor s application to intervene. Zuma also wants to amend his application.The Democratic Alliance has opposed Zuma s application for a postponement.
