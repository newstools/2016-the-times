Nhleko wrote to Mbete last month after the Constitutional Court ruled the powers with which the minister suspended McBride were unconstitutional.In it Nhleko asked Parliament to look into the matter of opening an inquiry into McBride an action which would empower Nhleko to suspend McBride again. Mbete responded a month later to say only the National Assembly could make the determination and referred the matter to the portfolio committee on police.The police committee concurred with the Speaker s view.Parliament next sits on October 25. This cleared the way for McBride to return to the helm of Ipid after his suspension expired on Wednesday.On Wednesday Nhleko slammed Parliament for failing to deal with the matter on time. Mbete responded saying she had noted the statement by the police minister with grave concern . The statement in its totality raises serious concerns and casts aspersions on Parliamentary processes. This is unprecedented unwarranted and unfortunate. Parliament operates on the basis of rules and set processes and these were followed in this regard her statement said.Mbete said the matter would be taken up with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa urgently.Nhleko s spokesman said while the statement was not discussed at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday Nhleko had expressed the contents of the letter to his political principles .
