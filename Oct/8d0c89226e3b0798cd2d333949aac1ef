Ahmed Timol died when he fell from the 10th floor of what was then John Vorster Square on October 27 1971.At the time he was the 22nd person to die in police custody. An inquest was held a year later - it ruled that his death was not caused by the security police and that he had committed suicide.His family and community never accepted the verdict.Timol's family learnt on Tuesday that National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams had requested the justice minister to approach the judge president of the Gauteng High Court to appoint a judge for an inquest."It is not going to be a simple case because of how old it is, but we have compelling evidence," said Luvuyo Mfaku, spokesman for National Prosecuting Authority.Mfaku would not reveal what the compelling evidence was.But Timol's nephew, ImtiazCajee, said it had to do with a detailed affidavit provided by Saleem Essop, who was with Timol on the night he was detained at a roadblock in Coronationville on the West Rand. Timol, a school teacher, had recently returned from the Soviet Union and was involved in the then-banned ANC and SA Communist Party. Cajee said Essop's affidavit describedhow he had been tortured by the police."It must have been difficult for him to relive this," said Cajee, who first approached the NPA 10 years ago to reopen the inquest. It was turned down because of a lack of evidence."Now hopefully we can clear his name, we owe it to him," he said.
