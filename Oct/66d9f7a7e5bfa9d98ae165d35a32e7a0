1) Cassper's concert at Orlando Stadium on Saturday night was historic. He didn't manage to fill it to capacity but that didn't matter. The fact that he had a 30 000 strong crowd is in itself a massive achievement2) You've probably missed the news that Des van Rooyen visited the Gupta family seven days in a row prior to being announced as finance minister last year, reported the Sunday Times.The paper claimed the visits were revealed during investigations by the public protector into alleged state capture by the family.3) AKA and Cassper made up. As in kissed and hugged. And it got caught on camera.So, how the hell did that happen?Well, on the day of his #FillUpOrlandoStadium concert, AKA took to Twitter to wish his rival well.Good Morning! This is the day the lord has made. @casspernyovest, today is your day. Good luck &amp; God bless.We know that they two have had beef. Hell, everybody knows that they don't like each other. There have been guns pointed, slaps thrown, major shade online. But at the end of 2015, both said they'd be putting their issues aside and would be focusing on their music.Yeah, there's been the odd sub-tweet here or there, but nothing enough to cause too much of a stir.Then AKA went to Cassper's after-party!Not content with sending a brother some love on social media, AKA put in some extra TLC.He headed to Taboo night club in Sandton where the official after-party for Fill Up Orlando Stadium was held.He saw Cassper and leaned in for a hug, whispering into his ear.Eyewitnesses who were at the party say people started clapping.Photographer Thembani Manganyi caught the moment.
