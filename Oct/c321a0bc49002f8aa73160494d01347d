Pizza, the polar bear living at an aquarium at China's Grandview Mall, made headlines around the world after animal activists claimed he "suffers for selfies".Now a number of petitions calling for Pizza to be rehomed have amassed a million signatures worldwide. It comes as new video footage of the polar bear was released by the Humane Society International and its Chinese partner group VShine.Alastair Macmillan, a veterinary adviser for HSI, said Pizza was showing signs of "mental decline" in the clip."This polar bear is showing classic stereotypical behaviour, including head swaying and repetitive pacing, induced by frustration and poor welfare," he said."This is the animal's attempts to cope with stressful, aversive situations such as barren enclosures, boredom and constant disturbance by visitors."The conditions in which he is being kept are completely unsuitable, vastly removed from anything approaching his natural habitat. If something is not done he will likely slip further into mental decline."Last month, Pizza was offered a new home at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park's habitat for polar bears.However, Grandview's general manager said there was "no need for foreign organisations to get nvolved". He added: "We are a legally compliant aquarium, run according to Chinese standards and protecting animal rights. In the future we will strengthen the protection of animal rights and welfare."
