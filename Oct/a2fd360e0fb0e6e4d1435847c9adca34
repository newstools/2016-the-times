Also seized by the police was hospital theatre medication, including anaesthetic.The discovery has shone a light on illegal abortions and on what seems to be the inability of the government and the Health Professions Council of SA (HPCSA) to stop deregistered doctors from practising.Health Department spokesman Joe Maila said illegal abortions were rife.Eddie Mhlanga, the Mpumalanga health department's obstetrics and gynaecology specialist, said that for every natural miscarriage or abortion in a hospital, five women were admitted to a hospital because of complications from illegal abortions.The Health Department's abortion figures show that, in the 2012-2013 financial year, 89,124 legal abortions were performed.The department's own officials and private health experts have slammed the department and criticised state hospital managers for their role in the proliferation of backstreet abortion clinics.Police and Health Professions Council inspectors arrested the Pretoria doctor on Tuesday after one of her patients was rushed to hospital by relatives following a botched abortion.The doctor was deregistered in 2008 after she failed to pay her annual HPCSA fees. She had allegedly been practicing illegally. A policeman said they had found a "nightmare"."We counted over 22 [foetuses]."He said the seized medication had been stolen from Gauteng government hospitals.Council spokesman Priscilla Sekhonyana said the doctor was deregistered for failing to pay her council fees, "a criminal offence".Mzukisi Grootboom, chairman of the SA Medical Association, said the number of bogus and deregistered doctors practising was increasing."The council only acts on such people when alerted by the public."There's absolutely no enforcement to stamp this out."He said that because of a belief that private-practice doctors were better than state doctors, women increasingly went to private doctors for abortions, unaware that many "doctors" were practising illegally.Mhlanga, who was involved in the implementation of South Africa's Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, said women chose illegal abortions for various reasons."These include the Health Department not prioritising termination of pregnancy services at public hospitals, and the lack of political and hospital leadership to ensure that these services are offered."Few hospitals tell of the termination services they offer. Hospital management is often the gatekeeper in preventing women from accessing termination services."Mhlanga said medics involved in abortions were discriminated against by hospital management and colleagues.Some hospital medical workers were hostile to women admitted to terminate a pregnancy.He said the lack of information on abortion given by government hospitals to communities played a role in women risking an illegal abortion."This allows those performing illegal abortions to operate without hindrance."Mhlanga said that to provide abortions doctors and medical facilities had to have access to medical waste-disposal systems."If a facility has large quantities of body parts, such as in this case, it must be asked why they have not been disposed of."He said if abortions were offered doctors had to have agreements with hospitals to the effect that they could send patients there should there be complications during a procedure.Maila said those who performed illegal abortions were not doctors."They're bogus. The complications women have after botched procedures are life-threatening."Women have the right to choose to abort until 13 weeks.The law allows abortions at up to 20 weeks on the grounds of the mother's economic or social situation.After 20 weeks women and doctors have to show that the life of the mother or the child is at risk.Maila said the department ran education campaigns to alert people to the dangers of illegal abortions.Sekhonyana said the council's inspectors made frequent compliance inspections."While the council has jurisdiction over medical practitioners registered with it, once a doctor is deregistered the council cannot lodge a complaint against that person."That's why our inspectors work closely with the police."Police spokesman Thomas Mufamadi said the woman doctor had been charged with possession of human body parts and illegal possession of scheduled medication.- Additional reporting by Katharine Child
