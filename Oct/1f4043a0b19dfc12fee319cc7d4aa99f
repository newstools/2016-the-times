The insinuations and claims that Trillian Capital Partners and its Chief Executive Officer Dr Eric Wood are somehow party to the activity that has recently enjoyed many print columns and has been styled state capture are quite simply untrue. Those wild and unsubstantiated allegations have extremely damaging repercussions for the reputation of an emerging and growing black-owned Financial Services Group and to that of Dr Wood the company stated. The Gupta family has no shareholding or other interest whatsoever in Trillian Holdings. It has no link to Trillian Holdings or to any of the other constituent members of the Trillian group of companies Trillian added.It referred to the whistleblower whom it named as a disgruntled former employee who it alleged had committed a number of criminal offences adding that a criminal prosecution would shortly ensue. Trillian reiterates that it is confident that as far as its actions are concerned all due processes were followed and that it delivered high-quality work and value to all its clients. The company continues to conduct its business in keeping with the highest standards of corporate governance and service delivery and will continue do so the company said.
