Tinkler said he had begun work on tactics for the match against Sundowns straight after last Wednesday's Telkom Knockout victory over Bloemfontein Celtic. "I've been watching a lot of them and studying them. They have now almost got two teams - a league team and a CAF team."But in terms of how they play, that doesn't really change, just the personnel..."Tinkler said he was not sure which Sundowns lineup he would face on Sunday because the Brazilians first play on Thursday night against Polokwane City in the Telkom Knockout first round, just more than a day after their scheduled arrival from Egypt.
