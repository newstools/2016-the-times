City captain Lebogang Manyama led by example with a brace and an impressive performance to help the new boys record their third league win of the season.Sundowns were deserved losers but after their energy-sapping CAF Champions League and Telkom Knockout Cup victories, this loss was due. However, it was the absence of a cohesive performance from their back four that will leave coach Pitso Mosimane worried. They also looked jaded and fatigued.When City took the lead in the 22nd minute, it was a deserved lead as the visitors had done the most of the incisive running.They seemed to respond better to the heat than Sundowns did.While they did not look like a side that was disrespecting the game, it was clear they were battling to adapt to the slower pace of the league. After all, it was only their second league game of the season and it showed.Manyama was causing all sorts of havoc in his free role upfront and was at the heart of everything good by the visitors.He caused most of the trouble from the right-hand side, whence the goal came when Ebrahim Seedat's pass found the dangerous Aubrey Ngoma, who slipped the key assist through to his captain.Ngoma should have scored City's second in the 43rd minute when Asavela Mbekile got in the way of his shot with Kennedy Mweene all over the place.It was clear Sundowns were having issues with City's pace and teams with fast attackers may take note of this. Sundowns found an equaliser in the 58th minute through a Thabo Nthethe header from a Khama Billiat freekick .Halftime substitute Lehlohonolo Majoro should have put City in the lead in the 79th minute but his indecision allowed Sundowns to clear the danger. Manyama was not so generous four minutes later, converting from a cross from the left after Sundowns uncharacteristically lost their defensive shape, with Thapelo Morena at fault this time.Other results:Baroka FC 2 Polokwane City 2 Highlands Park 2 Free State Stars 2
