The supporters again arrived in their numbers but two Soweto foes dished out another edgy goalless draw at FNB Stadium.Komphela felt his side had edged the game, and could have got more than a share of the points. I thought both sides applied themselves very well, and typical of us where we tried to play a very constructive game, and the only one thing we couldn t get to was to get quickly behind the defence, Komphela said. And even in situations where Orlando Pirates had possession, I had a feeling that we were not as quick on the transition in the attack. And that allowed them time to get back into defensive spaces. In terms of chances, I thought we did have them. One has to go back and look at the number concerning both teams, but I had a feeling that we might have had an edge with regards to chances. And in matches of this nature it s small margins. But we re delighted with a clean sheet our defence has been doing very well. And not just the defence but the team defending as a unit. The excitement of the game the ultimate I goals. Unfortunately we denied people goals. But we tried to play a very constructive game. It was Chiefs seventh match unbeaten in league and cup matches, and they went back to the top of the PSL standings.
