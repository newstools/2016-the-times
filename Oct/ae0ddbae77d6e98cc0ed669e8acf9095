Connel shocked fan last month when he took to Instagram to announce that he had got married to his fianc e Sarah while in New York."I know I've been real quiet lately, I'm sorry if I've worried some of you! It's only because these last few weeks have flown by like a whirlwind and I wanted to live every moment of them through my own eyes rather than through a screen. I want to share something wonderful with you. Last year I met the most amazing woman. I realized I couldn't live without her. I asked her, she said yes, and a few days ago we married in New York City," he wrote to fans.He later took to Twitter to reveal that he loved everything about being married.So far, I have to say I love everything about being Married.
