Pirates coach Muhsin Ertugral said after the game at FNB Stadium on Saturday that three of his players goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo, Memela and Manyisa had eaten out together on Tuesday night, and gone down with food poisoning.Manyisa was not included in Pirates squad against Chiefs and replaced by Gift Motupa in the starting line-up. Memela was in the starting XI having been cleared by a doctor to play, but was replaced within an hour of kick-off by Riyaad Norodien.Mhlongo played, though had to be treated in the 31degreesC heat at one stage in the first half for light-headedness.Ertugral said he had been impressed by Norodien coming in late for Memela. Riyaad for me, is one of the best talents. He needs a bit more time, Ertugral said. Also, this is a big club. There are other elements and dynamics in the team s organisational form. But he had a fantastic game today. He replaced Memela because they [the three players] ate something this week. They could not train on Wednesday they were in hospital and it was food poisoning. Memela had been cleared by the doctor to play. But in the end it came back. And it was very dangerous I was very happy it happened before the game. The three had food poisoning. They went out eating something together. And I m happy that our goalkeeper could play. Ertugral had refused to comment on his injury list in the week before the game and the potential absence of the three appears to have been the reason.
