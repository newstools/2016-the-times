Van Breda and his girlfriend Danielle Janse van Rensburg appeared in the Cape Town Magistrates' Court on Wednesday on drug charges.They were arrested in the suburb of Table View last month for possession of dagga. At the time his lawyer Lorinda van Niekerk told the Sunday Times: "His girlfriend has admitted in court that the dagga belonged to her. Henri maintains that he is not guilty of the charge against him." The court postponed the matter to April 11 for the outcome of an assessment by NICRO a non-profit organisation that specialises in social crime prevention and offender reintegration. Van Breda was cited as accused number two in the matter.He is out on R1000 bail while his girlfriend was released on bail of R200.The drug charges came three days before he was hauled before the High Court in Cape Town to answer to murder charges. Van Breda allegedly killed his father Martin his mother Teresa and his brother Rudi with an axe in their upmarket home at De Zalze Winelands Golf Estate in Stellenbosch last year. He faces a further charge of the attempted murder of his sister Marli.The Sunday Times interviewed a man who lived in an informal settlement near the Van Bredas' home in February 2015 who claimed to be Van Breda's drug runner.A provisional date for the murder trial is February 6 2017.
