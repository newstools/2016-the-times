After MTV made the announcement that Bonang Matheba would be taking over the hosting duties from an ill Trevor, many took to Twitter to share their conflicting thoughts regarding the broadcaster's decision."We are tired of her face" was a constant theme in the messages of those who were unimpressed that Bonang would be hosting this year's MAMAs. Scoop &gt; Bonang. We're tired of her face. We Not Saying Bonang Is Not Good Enough To Replace Trevor Noah On The #MAMAs We're Just Tired Of Her we know Bonang is talented and all but we just tired of her now. we need someone new, someone hungry and someone who really needs this.And it was only a matter of time until the #OpenUpTheIndustry debate was brought back from the edge of death, with users lashing out and questioning why MTV had chosen a well-known celebrity, instead of looking for fresh talent.I fail to understand why people in power keep empowering people who are already up there. How about grooming new faces??#OpenUpTheIndustry The likes of Bonang want to take up everything in the industry including being part of the Dragonball Z cast #OpenUpTheIndustry Recently the Entertainment Industry is full of Good lookin boys &amp; Beautiful Girls with plenty of Swagg but Dololo talent #OpenUpTheIndustryTrevor only made the announcement that he will no longer be gracing South African shores on Friday morning. He has a severe respiratory and ear infection and said doctors ordered him to get bed rest.Understandably, this gave organisers very little time to find a replacement. Given the mammoth magnitude of the awards show, other users pointed out that it would be a huge risk to take a TV novice, in an attempt to #OpenUpTheIndustry, to host the MAMAs. Therefore, they argued that Bonang is one of very few people who would be able to present the show given less than 24hours to prepare.This sparked a debate that saw the hashtag #OpenUpTheIndustry topping the trends list.Name people that would pull off hosting a big show without a glitch at such short notice. This #OpenUpTheIndustry discussion is misplaced. #OpenUpTheIndustry 24hours before an international broadcast? With who's money and reputation at stake? pic.twitter.com/AgxZtYxCKw I'm all for #OpenUpTheIndustry, but the MAMAs to 30 million people across a whole continent on 24 hrs notice isn't the time or place tbh.
