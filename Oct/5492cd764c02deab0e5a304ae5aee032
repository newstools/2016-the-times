 They are not to be trusted with exercising state power with integrity the party s Dennis Bloem saidHis comments come a day after cellphone footage emerged of SARS deputy director of law Vlok Symington being locked in a boardroom while the Hawks and Moyane's bodyguards attempted to get him to make an affidavit in the fraud case against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. This is a clear case of abuse of power which must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. It has no place in a country that values the rule of law said Bloem.His party has no trust in Ntlemeza to take any action against his poodles . He was described by a judge to lack integrity said Bloem referring to Judge Elias Matojane s comments in a North Gauteng High Court judgment which found that Ntlemeza had made false statements under oath when he suspended then Gauteng Hawks head Major-General Shadrack Sibiya. The criminal enterprise presided over by (President) Jacob Zuma is clearly in a desperate and reckless overdrive to intimidate even law-abiding officials at SARS and other state institutions from doing their professional duties with integrity. They are desperate to cover their criminal tracks and to save their puppet master Jacob Zuma from an inevitable fall from grace in the not too distant future. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) confirmed on Thursday that Symington had opened a case of kidnapping with it.Symington was the author of the 2009 legal opinion which the Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom Under Law used to file an application to the Pretoria High Court requesting that the fraud charges against Gordhan be set aside.In that opinion he states that there was "no technicality" stopping SARS from reappointing former deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay on a contract basis after an early retirement payout.
