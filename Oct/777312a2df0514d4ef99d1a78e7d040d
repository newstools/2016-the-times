The campaign - which is to stage the People s Assembly Against State Capture next Wednesday when Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan appears in court on fraud charges - called for Abrahams and Moyane to be dismissed because of their criminal collusion in manufacturing the charges against Gordhan. Every day that passes provides further confirmation that the charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and former SARS official Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula are not just politically motivated but are legally without any basis. They are an utter sham and without substance and we believe the courts will find likewise the campaign said in a statement.The campaign said the latest confirmation of this was the action of SARS deputy director Vlok Symington and SARS attorney David Makapela who outlined in affidavits their refusal to become accomplices in the NPA s heavy-handed attempts to concoct a case against Gordhan and his co-accused. The state s blunders in the case against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan are increasingly stimulating a people s campaign to put an end to state capture and to rescue the democratic state the campaign said.The campaign said it had been inundated with responses since announcing the People s Assembly less than a week ago and was now working actively with political parties and other civil society organisations to coordinate events.It said all political parties had been invited to be part of the People s Assembly especially those that have already planned marches to show their opposition to state capture.The campaign s steering committee was also liaising with organised labour as well as Business Leadership South Africa and the CEO Initiative - which represents the leaders of South Africa s top 100 companies. Numerous marches and protests will be able to converge at the People s Assembly on the corner of Bosman and Frances Baard streets a few hundred metres from the Pretoria Magistrate s Court from 8am on Wednesday. From that point protesters from across the political spectrum would join struggle stalwarts dozens of civil society organisations business labour and thousands of individual South Africans around a common cause: the need to stop state capture in its tracks.Under the umbrella of the Save South Africa campaign the programme in Pretoria on November 2 will include speakers from political organisations faith-based groups organised business labour and civil society. In this context the Save South Africa campaign urges Shaun Abrahams to save himself from further embarrassment and to avoid more damage to the shrinking integrity of the NPA and the Hawks. The campaign said organisations and individuals who had endorsed the Save South Africa campaign included struggle stalwarts Ahmed Kathrada Denis Goldberg and Ben Turok the Anglican Church Bishop Desmond Tutu Corruption Watch and Lawyers for Human Rights.-TMG Digital
