Thousands of them and their supporters, including pastors and parents, congregated at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology and timed their march to coincide with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan's medium-term budget policy statement.But they were met by a heavy police contingent that included the Western Cape's top cop, Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Elvis Jula, and his deputy, Major-General Thembisile Patekile."We are going to block [Gordhan and his team] from entering parliament," said a CPUT student who said they planned to stop Gordhan's speech.Among the protesters were students from Tshwane University of Technology and the Durban University of Technology.They carried a cardboard coffin bearing an image of Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande.One placard read: "Free Education First - Land Next".Students read out a memorandum that included demands for a corporate tax, a wealth tax and an education tax for "wealthy persons and for all monopoly industries listed on the JSE to service the implementation of free quality education by January 2017".Gordhan accepted the memorandum but exchanged heated words with student leaders.He was heard telling a student leader: "If you are barring us from speaking, it's fine."He said he needed to make a budget speech and there was no need to waste his time.Students threatened to shut down the country.As Gordhan delivered his speech, pandemonium erupted on the streets outside parliament.Chaos was sparked when the cardboard coffin was set alight and hurled at the police.Officers lobbed stun grenades and fired rubber bullets at the students, who responded by hurling rocks.The protesters eventually retreated to the CPUT campus.
