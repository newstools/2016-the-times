Addressing parliament yesterday, Nzimande reiterated the government's stance during a debate on university fees that free education for all was impossible, and that the government had worked hard to ensure the poor and the so-called missing middle were able to access higher education.Nzimande said 75% of University of Johannesburg students either paid very little or no fees.This figure at the University of Fort Hare was 90%, he said.The public service would suffer heavily if universities did not complete the academic year, the minister said."If the 2016 trainee teachers do not graduate, about 20,000 classrooms will be without teachers at the beginning of next year. "Junior doctors, those that are hoping to graduate this year, are at the front line of service delivery in public-sector hospitals."But EFF deputy leader Floyd Shivambu said the idea that free education was impossible was "ideologically bankrupt in an outdated and constipated system".He said a small levy should be charged on retirement funds which, according to his calculations, would create about R100-billion in funding.He said the Public Investment Corporation, which invests the government's pension funds, had managed to make multibillion-rand investments in companies and should be able to pay such a levy. This amount, coupled with the government's estimated R33-billion in funding through the department and the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, and increased corporate taxes, could create about R163-billion in income to fund university education, Shivambu said.The IFP's Mkhuleko Hlengwa called on the entire ANC caucus to resign, saying that the promises of free higher education the party had made were "lies"."You were elected on the basis of lies," Hlengwa said.The DA's Belinda Bazzoli said the ANC and its policies were responsible for creating the current heated situation seen on campuses around South Africa."The ANC has dithered like the 100-year-old lady that it is."
