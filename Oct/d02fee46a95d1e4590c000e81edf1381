For one thing, Zuma was subdued. At one point, his shirt collar poked out over his blue jacket and he seemed to be speaking softly and deliberately, without the swagger he has shown at previous appearances.He had to endure the by now usual disruption by the EFF. There were scuffles.One EFF member shouted out that Zuma was a "thief and a murderer". Security was summoned and EFF MPs were bundled out after refusing to obey the orders of chairman Thandi Modise.Then Zuma rose to answer questions, warming up slowly and eventually allowing himself a chuckle or two."It's not very often that I have an opportunity to interact with your members and I'm sure that they love hearing me," he said before laughing.It is not entirely reliable to attribute too much to appearances in politics, but there can be no question that this was a subdued, sombre performance.Zuma seemed tired of it all.Perhaps the heavy infighting which has broken out within the ANC has begun to take its toll. It's quite possible that Zuma is no longer at the rudder of the "Zuma faction", which frequently makes statements that he has to contradict - usually when he is out of the country.Outside parliament he is beginning to suffer political reverses.Just as question time was getting under way, news broke that Zuma had suspended NPA officials Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi, both of whom had been his staunch allies.On the evidence of today, Zuma is working to a script to stay out of trouble. Perhaps he is beginning to go out with a whimper, the bang having not materialised.
