The Wits management said it had been invited to attend the peace meeting hosted by the Academic Staff Association of Wits University church leaders and others at the Holy Trinity Church on Wednesday. We were asked to attend the meeting and through our presence to indicate our support for peaceful resolution and constructive negotiation. We have always said that we are open to engaging with students. We have repeatedly been accused of not wanting to meet students. We have reached out on several occasions and today is an example of where we were once again willing to engage to no avail. We have met with several students and student leaders directly and we will continue to do so in the hope of finding a peaceful negotiated settlement the Wits management said on Wednesday evening. We are disappointed that people felt that we should exit the peace meeting even after we had been invited to attend it said Professor Adam Habib Wits Vice-Chancellor and Principal. We remain committed to working with students and student leaders in trying to find solutions to these issues many of which can only be resolved at the national level. We recognise that passions are inflamed and that we should not take the reactions of some student leaders personally. Angry students at the meeting called for Habib to leave. Some students have accused the Wits vice chancellor of being responsible for the arrest of student activist Mcebo Dlamini.Wits management reiterated that it remained committed to completing the 2016 academic year while at the same time trying to address issues related to the funding and transformation of the higher education sector. We will continue to protect the University community to ensure that staff students and our infrastructure are safe and that the academic programme continues it stated.
