Zuma has made two applications in a bid to amend the relief he initially asked for from the court and to ask for tomorrow's hearing to be postponed.The DA said Zuma's applications were obfuscation.In papers submitted to court, the DA's attorney, Elzanne Jonker, said: "The president is in fact seeking to review and set aside the public protector's report. While he does not frame it as a review, in substance it can only be a review."If it [the report] is final, then it is valid unless and until it is set aside on review ... The president has manipulatively avoided calling for the review of the report because he wants, through the back door, to prevent the release of the report so he can pursue a review of the report. This court cannot countenance such abuse." The DA asked former public protector Thuli Madonsela in March to investigate allegations of state capture - alleged corrupt influence of the powerful Gupta business family on government appointments, contracts and state-owned businesses - after Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas claimed the family offered him the post of finance minister at their Saxonwold residence just days before then minister Nhlanhla Nene was removed, allegedly to take up a Brics Development Bank post. Nene joined Allan Gray as a non-executive director in April.Madonsela was going to release her state-capture report in her last week in office, but was stopped by looming court action by Zuma and minister Des van Rooyen.The DA, EFF and former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor have joined the case against Zuma, arguing for the release of the report.Zuma first served Madonsela with notice to interdict the report's release on the grounds that he was given too little time to respond to questions and not given a chance to interview witnesses who implicated him in state capture.Now Zuma is asking the court for an order declaring that former Madonsela's conduct in finalising her report was unlawful.He wants the court to direct Madonsela to let him make representations and interview witnesses according to the Public Protector Act, and that she be allowed to finalise her report only after hearing his representations.The latest applications come after fresh evidence of Van Rooyen, finance minister for just four days in December 2015, visiting the Gupta family's Saxonwold home on seven successive days before his appointment was announced.The Sunday Times reported yesterday that cellphone records used in the state-capture probe showed Van Rooyen visited the Guptas from December 2 to 8 and one of his advisers, Mohammed Bobat, visited the family on one of the days Van Rooyen was there.Bobat and Ian Whitley arrived as Van Rooyen's advisers at the National Treasury when Van Rooyen took over. Bobat was allegedly made Van Rooyen's special adviser to advance the interests of the Guptas' business associates, Salim Essa and Eric Wood.It is claimed Van Rooyen was appointed to push through the nuclear programme, which former finance minister Nene and current minister Pravin Gordhan reject. This rejection, it is claimed, is why Gordhan faces fraud charges on Wednesday. His court appearance coincides with a cabinet meeting in Cape Town, in which the nuclear-build programme will be discussed.The NPA's Luvuyo Mfaku denied a report that it had decided to drop charges against Gordhan. He said the NPA was "still talking" to lawyers for Gordhan's co-accused Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula.
