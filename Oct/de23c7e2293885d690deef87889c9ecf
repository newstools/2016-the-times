The Department of Correctional Services and police have launched a manhunt after Rhapael Kanyamazane 43 who slipped out of the Barberton Santa Hospital in Mpumalanga in the early hours of Wednesday morning. He was undergoing medical treatment at the facility wearing leg irons that were handcuffed to his bed. The department has launched an investigation into the escape incident which is expected to leave no stone unturned as the offender was guarded by two correctional officials said Correctional Services spokesman Manelisi Wolela. The two officials that were assigned to guard the offender have been contemplated for suspension whilst the preliminary investigation continues. Correctional Services and SAPS have sent an appeal to everyone to assist with any information that could lead to the re-arrest of offender Kanyamazane. Kanyamazane from Giyani in Limpopo is regarded as dangerous and members of the public were urged not to try to apprehend him but rather contact their nearest police station if he is spotted. Although the escape rate is low at 0.04% of the 161 000 inmates per year with a re-arrest rate of 80% the department remains concerned about any escape and continues to strive towards the ideal standard of zero escapes said Wolela.
