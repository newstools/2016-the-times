South African teams do not often come out of Egypt in one piece - but should Sundowns come out of Alexandria with their reputation intact in their CAF Champions League final second leg against Zamalek on Sunday, they will etch themselves into South African footballing history.Egyptian sides are not accustomed to playing catch-up football and a 3-0 deficit is difficult to make up.Unlike Liverpool's legendary Istanbul class of 2005, who reeled AC Milan in within 20 minutes, Zamalek have 90 minutes to do the same against a side chasing history."It's a confidence booster for us to go away with the three goals we've scored, but we want to shut our back door and make sure we don't concede any goals."We have to make sure we look for that one goal that will make life difficult for Zamalek."It's a goal that we need so badly and it's going to be very good for us if we win," Kekana said."It's a very big game and I think the biggest game of our lives. We are excited as a unit and I do think we have put ourselves in a very good position."
