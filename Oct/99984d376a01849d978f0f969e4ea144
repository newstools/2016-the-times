Chiefs new signing from SuperSport United Khumalo said a few weeks ago that being an Amakhosi player can be tough especially when one of Africa s biggest clubs are not winning games.He said that Chiefs players hide at home in that situation rather than face the wrath of their fans.Speaking ahead of his side s Premier League Soweto derby against Orlando Pirates at FNB Stadium on Saturday Komphela said Khumalo had merely come face to face with the reality of playing for the monster that is Chiefs. One Spanish guy once said: it is different to talk about fighting the bull as compared to being in the kraal with the bull Chiefs coach said of Khumalo s statement. He [Khumalo] is in the big pot now he is feeling it. When you are outside it s more from the eye. When you are inside it is from the skin you re feeling it. Ironically Khumalo s energy and dynamism on the left flank after his introduction for veteran Tsepo Masilela has played a part in Chiefs turning around a poor start to go four league matches unbeaten and top the early PSL table.Komphela has chosen to blood his new signings in a new-look squad slowly with the coach s tweaks such as Khumalo at left-back and Mitchell Katsvairo at striker yielding results. I think one hell of a benefit we have is that we re working with them on a daily basis and we can see the degree of comfort and improvement Komphela said of the progress of Amakhosi s new signings. So from where we sit we are still comfortable. And whenever they do come in they make a big difference. - TMG Digital Sport
