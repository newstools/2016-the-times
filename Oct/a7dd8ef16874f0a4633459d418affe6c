Mashaba travelled with Sundowns to Egypt on Mosimane's invitation last week and the Bafana coach was present when Sundowns beat Zamalek 3-1 on aggregate to win the African Champions League in Alexandria on Sunday night.The gesture was seen as an olive branch to Mashaba after the two coaches exchanged barbs in the media over the last few weeks.Mashaba was one of the many people Mosimane thanked in his arrival speech at OR Tambo Airport on Wednesday and he defused any suggestions of bad blood between the two coaches. Bra Shakes has been with us all the time Mosimane said. Bra Shakes was in all our team talks breakfasts and lunches."What you read on the newspapers don t take it [seriously] take what is genuine we are together. Tension between the two coaches was widely reported particularly during times when Mosimane wanted his stretched players to be excused from national duty.Two months ago Mashaba was not amused when Mosimane used a public forum to appeal to the national team coach to excuse some of the Downs players from national duty in a dead rubber 2017 Africa Cup of Nations tie against Mauritania and a friendly fixture against Egypt.The Bafana coach said at the time a simple phone call from his Sundowns counterpart would have achieved a great deal and they wouldn't have needed to communicate through the media.Mashaba went on record and said he would ignore any appeal done through the media and not via official communication to the South African Football Association (Safa).But all that is seemingly history and Mashaba was also present when Sundowns were celebrated at a ceremony held just outside OR Tambo International Airport.The Sundowns coach also expressed his gratitude to Safa the Premier Soccer League his club boss Patrice Motsepe his technical team government officials fans rival club bosses and their teams club personnel and to the media for playing a crucial role in his side s success on the continental stage. I want to thank the media who have been with us right throughout from Ndola to Dolisie and wherever."Our media has been very suppoortive. Last week before we played Zamalek at home we had coverage for seven days."I cut some of the pictures and posters and gave them to the players to show that when South Africa is united noone can stop us he said.The coach acknowledged the role the domestic clubs played in sharpening his side up in their continental sojourn. I want to thank all the PSL teams who have really kept us on our toes sharpened us and made sure that our mental strength is strong."Playing with us week in week out cups in between the Champions League. I called this programme Against All Odds and victory is certain today he said. - TMG Digital
