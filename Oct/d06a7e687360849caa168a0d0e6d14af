After an unconvincing start Amakhosi have edged up to the top spot in the Premier Soccer League. They have won four games in a row and gained in confidence as each successive performance has been more convincing.Komphela said he had always said Chiefs were on the right track in their planning and the players they have brought into a new-look squad but that talk is cheap and supporters will only be convinced by results and performances. They will always say some people act after a fact. But when you start responding after some facts then it makes more sense Komphela said in characteristically cryptic fashion. All that I m trying to say is that we said it before but because we were not getting results talk is as good as nothing. You have to keep to what you are building towards and also highlight it to the players. But then there s a positive reinforcement when results are coming. Still now you can only reflect on this towards the end of the season. My small challenge to all the colleagues [in the press] is go back and look at all the goals these kids have scored at Chiefs. They are all brilliant goals. But that kind of summary can only happen at the end of the season. For now we are still going through processing goals. It s only after a title that people look back and say But these guys score beautiful goals. There are a lot of them. And beautiful goals don t come by accident they are by design. Chiefs have 13 points from six games having suffered one defeat to set the pace in the PSL.Komphela s men will be well aware that several title contenders are playing catch-up in the amount of games played making a win for Amakhosi on Saturday against their arch-rivals Pirates all the more important to keep their noses ahead.Among the heavyweight chasers are Bidvest Wits on 10 points from four games Pirates on nine from five and bottom-placed Mamelodi Sundowns on one point from one game.
