DA spokesman on sports and recreation Solly Malatsi said on Sunday that Mbalul had been quick to announce incentives of R100 000 to winners R40 000 to second place finishers and R20 000 to third place finishers immediately after the race. Yet five months after the Minister's announcement he has failed to pay the athletes their well-earned incentives for their sterling performance during the race Malatsi charged.He asserted that this was not the first time that Mbalula had neglected to add action to his words . He is also yet to pay the incentives promised to Olympic and Paralympic medalists. Mbalula s spokesperson Esethu Hasane commented that the minister couldn t have known how many medals would be won at the Olympics. This is absolute rubbish as the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) and his department had agreed on a target of 10 medals long in advance of the Olympics and should have budgeted accordingly Malatsi stated.
