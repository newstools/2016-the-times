Bavuyise Kwaziwa of Nkaneng section in Wonderkop near Rustenburg was accused of gunning down National Union of Mineworkers branch chairwoman Norah Abongile Madola in August 2013 while she was walking back to her home holding a live chicken. She was working for Lonmin platinum mine at the time of her death. The case was postponed to Friday for sentencing after Kwaziwa's legal representative told the court that his client did not pay his legal fees. - TMG Digital/Sowetan
