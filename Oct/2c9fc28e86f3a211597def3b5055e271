Pearl shared a verse from Proverbs. "'Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it'' Proverbs 2:23," Pearl posted on Twitter.But Twitter pastors felt it important to correct her, pointing out that there was no such verse in the bible.Apparently she quoted the wrong chapter and it should have been Proverbs 4.23.At first the said she didn't really care but was happy that people were taking notice.Now she's had some fun, poking fun at the hate.
