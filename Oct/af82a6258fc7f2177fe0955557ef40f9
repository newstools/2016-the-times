African National Congress parliamentary chief whip Jackson Mthembu has threatened to sue the SABC boss after reports that Motsoeneng had threatened to unveil his files on Mthembu.The ANC in Parliament labelled the remarks attributed to Motsoeneng as defamatory malicious spurious and laughable."Our only interest is to ensure a functional efficient and well-managed public broadcaster that executes its public service mandate."By publicly and deliberately alleging otherwise including improper motives Mr Motsoeneng has severely maligned the person of the Chief Whip " the ANC in Parliament said in a statement."The Chief Whip harbours no other interest regarding the SABC including personal interests other than those which are shared by the ANC."...The personal attacks are a further testimony to the crisis at the SABC and points to the lengths Mr Motsoeneng would go to abuse SABC platforms."The ANC said Mthembu states for the record that he has never at any point held any meeting with Motsoeneng.
