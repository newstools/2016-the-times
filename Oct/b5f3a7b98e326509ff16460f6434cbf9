According to Kruger Sightings on YouTube, Matthew Poole, a professional guide at &amp;beyond s Kirkman s Camp in the Sabi Sands, watched the scene play out, describing it as the 'rarest sighting' in his guiding career. Poole said that they spotted the leopard and lion lying on either side of the riverbank. As the leopard went to sleep the lion started to stalk him from the other side of the river. Fortunately, the lion didn t kill the leopard, but did manage to scare the daylights of the leopard, driving it up into a tree.
