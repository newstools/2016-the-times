But, to achieve his goal, the 21-year-old has to pass his Grade 12 - a task made more difficult because his school - Maligana Wilson Secondary School in Mashau village - was one of 24 badly damaged in May by residents who protested over the incorporation of their area into Malamulele.His house is close to the school and Moraba is taking full advantage of this.His day starts at 4am when he studies for an hour at home before going to school, where he joins others for their morning study sessions, which start at 6.30am .They study together for an hour before "normal" school starts.When school ends at 2.30pm, the group remains and studies until 6pm."The mind needs to rest. So those who stay closer to the school like me go home to rest for three hours. We then come back and go on until midnight. In many cases, we end up sleeping at the school."I am pained when criminals get away with crime."When I return with my law degree, I will ensure this never happens," said Moraba.
