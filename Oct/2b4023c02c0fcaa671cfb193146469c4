Economist Iraj Abedian tweeted: "Shaun Abrahams has caused massive brand damage to SA! It is a shame on him on team NPA and his political handlers. Is this 3rd force in action?!""Shaun the honourable thing to do now is to resign. Then you should write a book revealing all " former top banker Michael Jordaan shared.Gordhan was set to face two charges of fraud this week linked to his rubber-stamping of early retirement for Pillay, a former deputy SARS deputy commissioner, and then reappointing him on contract in 2010, during the minister s first stint as the head of the Treasury.Abrahams has come under intense pressure since he announced during a media briefing two weeks ago that Gordhan had been summonsed to appear in court on November 2 on two charges of fraud.This was exacerbated when it emerged in media reports that Abrahams had met President Jacob Zuma at ANC headquarters Luthuli House a day before he announced that Gordhan had been summonsed.Abrahams said in a letter to Gordhan s attorney on Monday that after perusal of the matter he had decided to overrule the decision to prosecute the minister.
