The party made this demand on Monday the day Abrahams reviewed and set aside the decision to charge Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and two others with fraud. The EFF said it believed Abrahams violated his constitutional duties and was neither competent nor fit and proper to be an advocate of the high court. The party said Abrahams had an improper meeting at the headquarters of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) on October 10 a day before he announced the decision to charge Gordhan. It is unprecedented inexplicable and unjustifiable that the head of the NPA would hold meetings with leaders of political parties and the executives of the state at their party political head office to discuss anything related to potential prosecutorial matters the party said in a letter. The party also accused Abrahams of an improper meeting with an accused person . President Jacob Zuma is attempting to appeal against the re-institution of more than 780 criminal charges against him. Despite this Mr Abrahams held a meeting with President Zuma on 10 October 2016 at the offices of the ANC. It is highly improper and irregular for a person who is appealing the reinstatement of charges against him by the NPA to meet with the head thereof in a secret meeting. The EFF said there were sufficient reasons for the General Council of the Bar to apply for the striking of Abrahams from the roll of advocates. The EFF reserves its rights and may pursue this matter in court should the General Council of the Bar decline this request the EFF s secretary general Godrich Gardee said in the letter.In September senior NPA officials Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi were struck off the roll of advocates following several adverse judicial findings against them.- TMG Digital
