Ferreira has replaced Chean Roux as defence coach, but Roux will definitely be redeployed within the system. He is an inexperienced defence coach, but is effective in all other areas of coaching.Meanwhile, the appointment of Smith is an excellent addition to the Springbok management team and he will be tasked with overseeing the senior national side's backline play and skills.Smith's presence in the Springbok camp will prove invaluable owing to the fact that his level of self-confidence is at an all-time high after he guided the Free State Cheetahs to their first Currie Cup title since 2007.When Smith spoke at the indaba, he was very impressive in terms of his technical knowledge of attack. I'm convinced he can sharpen an offence that managed to notch only eight tries during the recent Rugby Championship. By contrast, the men from the Free State set the gold standard for attacking play in the Currie Cup and registered 55 tries - the most in the competition.Smith's input on attack at senior national level could be a panacea for the poison. And, despite some media reports to the contrary, the general consensus in local coaching circles is that the Springboks need to continue down the route they have chosen - a ball-in-hand approach - because it will ultimately see them become a better attacking unit.The appointment of Smith is the right way forward but, at the same time, it would be ridiculous to throw away the services of 32-year-old assistant coach Mzwandile Stick. He is a bright, energetic young backline coach, who possesses talent and potential.Having forged a burgeoning working relationship at the indaba, I'm confident that Smith and Stick will put their egos aside and pool their energies to plot the way forward for the Springboks' backline play.Stick is in the infancy of his national coaching career and will profit from Smith's years of experience. I'm sure Smith is humble enough to acknowledge that although Stick has genuine potential as a coach, he needs to be mentored by a senior colleague.Smith, 44, has served his apprenticeship, having coached in Italy and South Africa, and Stick will benefit massively from his knowledge.In terms of the Springboks' end-of-year-tour, which commences on Saturday next week, I'm confident we will witness an upsurge in performance from Allister Coetzee's charges. The primary reason for my optimism is that the players will spend an extra 20 minutes after each training session - three a week - working on areas that have been identified as weaknesses.The prevailing feeling among the coaches at the indaba was that our skill and decision-making in terms of attack, defence and the aerial contest are more important than the plan we want to employ.Coetzee has thus taken a pragmatic approach and has scheduled overtime for the players in an effort to arrest a poor run of results, which has seen the Springboks earn a substandard 44% win percentage from nine Tests played this term.
