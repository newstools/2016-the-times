In a 3-minute video teaser, the company unveiled Nintendo Switch, its first new gaming device in four years, which will launch in March 2017. Switch can be used as both a traditional gaming console as well as a handheld device.SwitchAccording to Nvidia, the Switch is powered by their Tegra processor, which includes a Graphics Processing Unit based on their GeForce graphics cards.The Switch is also supported by fully custom software, including a revamped physics engine, new libraries, advanced tools and new gaming APIs, according to a statement released by Nvidia.Nintendo, as this graphic illustrates, needs to be a success, especially after its last console, the Wii U, flopped badly.So let's break down the trailer and discuss the things we like - and the things that gave us pause.What we like:The focus on local multiplayer gaming is definitely a plus, as is the fact the console effectively comes with two controllers.And you have to be excited about the games already lined up for the console, including The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario, and Splatoon. Dozens of publishers such as Activision Publishing Inc, Electronic Arts Inc and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc are developing games for the device.The mobility of the system may be a bit of a game changer the system looks like it is aiming to replace both the 3DS and the home console. This should hopefully mean the system gets the full attention of Nintendo, rather than having to compete for resources with the more reliably profitable handheld division. That flop of the Wii U helped push Nintendo into mobile gaming, leading to the runaway success of Pokemon GO and plans to debut its game franchise Super Mario Bros on Apple Inc's iPhone in December.What we don't:For some reason the trailer heavily features Skyrim HD edition, yet according to Gamespot, that game hasn t been confirmed for the system.Making Skyrim such a centre-point to the advert when it hasn t been confirmed yet, feels a bit disingenuous. If there is one element to the trailer that wearen't entirely certain of, it can reduce the trust we have in the package overall. After all the Wii U also looked very good at the preview stage.Nintendo has also remained silent on the key issue of pricing.However, according to PC Advisor Tesco briefly listed the console as costing 349 which translates to about R5977.57.Hopefully this new system is a return to form, but we shall have to wait and see on it.- additional reporting by Reuters
