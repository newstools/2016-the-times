We know he's been on a major weight-loss mission ahead of his Fill Up Orlando Stadium concert. He even showed us a near naked image of himself. And while Cassper is out at the gym flexing in his music video, we're out here appreciating.The 4:52 minutes clip opens with Cassper getting ready to run through the streets of Jozi (and boy, can he bolt), before cutting to a scene of him in a boxing ring. Fitting, given that the song speaks about hustling and fighting your way through to the top.But if there's one thing you can take away from the video it's that Cassper will stop at nothing to ensure that his 6-pack becomes an 8-pack. It's bound to happen.Watch the space!
