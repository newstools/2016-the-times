"Lmao... I dropped the ball dawg," he said.But this hasn't deterred the rapper from winning over Minnie's heart and he even has a strong message for her man.Speaking to DJ Fresh on 5FM during an interview on Monday, Cassper explained that when Minnie walked into one of his interviews, he "lost his mind"."Minnie showed up while I was doing an interview and I lost my mind. It's probably on video. I want to give her babies and marry her and all that butterfly stuff. He (her man) needs to relax. You had your turn, what did you do with it? He needs to marry her. Once I get the chance I'm going to put a ring on it," Cassper said.I meant but come on @MinnieDlamini .
