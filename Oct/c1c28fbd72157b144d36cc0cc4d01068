Alexandria Egypt - Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane thanked Orlando Pirates and Bidvest Wits for the role they played in his side winning the Caf Champions League. Sundowns became club kings of Africa by preserving a 3-0 advantage from the home leg with a 1-0 defeat in the second leg of the Caf Champions League final at Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria on Sunday night. Mosimane said Pirates two runs to continental finals in the past three years the 2013 Champions League (ACL) and last year s Confederation Cup had changed the approach of SA clubs to playing in such competitions and paved the way for Sundowns win. He said Wits 3-0 victory against Sundowns in the MTN8 final in Nelspruit two weeks before the first leg of the ACL final in Atteridgeville last Saturday had kept Downs on their toes. It has been a milestone and a long journey. Orlando Pirates have carried us and we copied them Mosimane said. And this type of game you should win at home. You can t come here and look for a result. It s a very big lesson for the Champions League you ve got to win at home and we won all our games at home. But I believe that any team playing in the Champions League will pay a heavy price. You get injuries. We could have lost the league last season because of the Champions League. We did lose the Nedbank Cup. We ve dropped two league points already this season against Maritzburg United [in a 1-1 draw with a B team]. But if you win it [the Champions League] it s really worth it. And I also want to thank Wits and Gavin [Hunt their coach] for giving us a wake-up call in the MTN8. It gave us a little bit of humility and we knew how to defend to win this trophy. But for me as a coach I can t ask for more. I think that was the one left and I had to win it. Mosimane has won every trophy domestically in South Africa and now realised a long-held ambition of coaching a team to being champions of Africa.* Marc Strydom is in Egypt as a guest of Mamelodi Sudnowns - TMG Digital
