Gordhan lifted the lid on the Gupta family's "suspicious" bank transactions in an application to the Pretoria High Court for a declaratory ruling that he did not have the power to intervene in the dispute between the Gupta family and the major banks that refused to continue holding the accounts of Gupta companies.Court papers filed by Gordhan on Friday include an affidavit by the director of the Financial Intelligence Centre in which 72 suspicious transactions linked to the Guptas, and three to President Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane, are listed.They are flagged in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act, which requires banks to report activities that could be related to money laundering, sponsorship of terrorism or tax evasion.The Gupta family on Tuesday dismissed suggestions that some of its bank transactions were linked to criminal activity, describing them as "little more than the usual political games".
