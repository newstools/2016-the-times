Flyhalf Niel Marais contributed 21 points with seven penalties to set the home team on their way with two late tries underlining their dominance in the final quarter.Fullback Clayton Blommetjies scored his team s first try in the 63rd minute, which ended the game as a contest with the home team taking an unassailable 28-9 lead.Victory was built on the ability to continually look to crack open the Bulls defence with ball in hand. The visitors simply couldn t manage the intensity the Cheetahs brought to the contest and spent most of the afternoon trapped deep in their territory.Free State also dominated possession and the Bulls also suffered in terms of penalty count, losing that battle 13-8 as well.Centre Francois Venter was the playmaker in chief for the Cheetahs, often popping up at flyhalf to direct play as the home team looked to attack space in the narrow channels early on.Wing Raymond Rhule, who also drifted into the first receiver position several times made some line breaks but the Bulls scrambling defence was initially equal to the task and kept the Cheetahs at bay.The Bulls had to live in the edge to stem the tide and as a result gave away too many penalties inside Marais range and radar. He landed six out of six in the first half to ensure that the scoreboard kept moving even if the Cheetahs couldn t breach the tryline.The home team though, overplayed their hand at times and twice, trying to run restarts out of their 22, ran down blind alleys where Bulls openside Roelof Smit happily hunched his broad shoulders over the ball and won penalties.Bulls flyhalf Tian Schoeman slotted two of his three first half penalties this way while the other came when Cheetahs centre Nico Lee was too eager on defence and found himself offsides.Cheetahs flank Uzair Cassiem was just one of several indefatigable foot soldiers that laid the foundation for victory.Hooker Torsten van Jaarsveld was everywhere and lock Reniel Hugo was a rock for the home team in the tight exchanges. This was a team victory in every way.After the break the Bulls opened the second half with promise and had centre Burger Odendaal spotted a wide open Jamba Ulengo, who would have scored unopposed, the game might have played out differently.As it was the Cheetahs kept turning the screw through Marais boot before Blommetjies try that ensured the old Cup was coming to Bloemfontein.Replacement scrumhalf Piet van Zyl pulled back a late try for the Bulls to add a dollop of respectability.But the final bow went to flying Cheetahs wing Sergeal Petersen, who rounded off a lovely break by replacement flyhalf Fred Zeilinga to add gloss to the occasion.Scorers:Free State Tries: Clayton Blommetjies, Sergeal Petersen. Conversion: Fred Zeilinga. Penalties: Niel Marais (7), Zeilinga.Blue Bulls Try: Piet van Zyl. Conversion: Joshua Stander. Penalties: Tian Schoeman (3).
