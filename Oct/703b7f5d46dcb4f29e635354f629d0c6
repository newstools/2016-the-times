The address, according to the EFF's motion tabled this week, would "specifically focus" on advocate Madonsela's experiences as public protector and "lessons that should apply to all public representatives, public servants and the public in the provision of quality services for all".Opposition MPs, especially from the EFF, had expected Madonsela to use the opportunity to take the national legislature into her confidence about her report on state capture.But the proposal was rejected yesterday at a meeting of the National Assembly programme committee, which was chaired by deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli.
