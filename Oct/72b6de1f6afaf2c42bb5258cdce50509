This had drawn some criticism when her replacement Busisiwe Mkhwebane on Wednesday told Parliament that PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) were used to help complete the controversial document that the president and one of his ministers don t want released.Madonsela said of Mkhwebane being quizzed on her report that: Firstly it was unfair on her to be expected to defend someone else s report. Mkhwebane's appearance in Parliament was to present her new office's annual report for the 2015/16 financial year.She also said it was not for politicians to question how she compiled the report. On the issue of consultants... it is purely at the discretion of the public protector it is not for Parliament or anyone to tell the public protector how to do her work. The public protector has discretion to decide how to deploy resources she told Radio 702.As her seven-year tenure was coming to an end Madonsela looked outside her office to ensure the report was finalised before she left office. I played open cards I told the nation I will not be able to do this investigation - required to be done within 30 days - if I don t use external resources. I requested those resources and I openly indicated once I had those resources. She said the team worked commission-style under my supervision . The findings in that report or rather the conclusions in that report are entirely mine and certainly not the team s Madonsela said.President Jacob Zuma and Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen have both applied to court for an interdict preventing the release of the report which was to be released last Friday and in which their relationship with the influential Gupta family features.
