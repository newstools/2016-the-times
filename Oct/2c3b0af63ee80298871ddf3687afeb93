DA leader Mmusi Maimane said at a media briefing on Thursday that he had sent a letter to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete requesting an urgent debate on the motion. He noted that the party was acutely aware of the prevailing scepticism when a minority party tables a motion that requires majority support. Previous motions of no confidence have failed.The motion comes in the context of mounting criticism of the president by African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts and the support that ministers have given to Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan who has been charged with fraud.Maimane said many senior ANC members had publicly taken a stand against Zuma and his project of state capture."We can't simply sit by and do nothing because of the risk of the motion not being passed. We cannot render the role of Parliament and the constitutional provisions involved to be rendered useless. If we did that we may as well not recognise Parliament at all Maimane said.The motion he explained would present ANC MPs the opportunity to vote against the president and his leadership. Too often ANC MPs by supporting the executive have found themselves on the side of corruption instead of accountability. The ANC must work with us in Parliament to remove Jacob Zuma once and for all so we can get our country working again Maimane said.He emphasised that Zuma was at the heart of all the crises facing SA currently which threatened to undermine the country's progress.
