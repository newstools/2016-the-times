According to the Mail &amp; Guardian, Mkhwebane said she wanted the channel that feeds all the TVs in the building to be changed to the Gupta-owned news channel.She confirmed having asked why the TVs were tuned to eNCA, saying she wanted staff to monitor all news channels for a broader perspective.While a relatively minor thing, Mkhwebane s conduct is currently under intense scrutiny, especially when it comes to the handling of her predecessor's report on state capture.Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela had planned to release the report last Friday on the last day of her seven-year term before separate applications by President Jacob Zuma and Cooperative Minister Des Van Rooyen put a stop to that.The Guptas have gained notoriety for allegedly exploiting their closeness to Zuma, who has maintained that his friends have no undue influence over him.Mkhwebane said during a press briefing on Thursday that she had not taken a position in the application by Zuma and Van Rooyen and had yet to read the report which she said was under lock and key.
