The National Sea Rescue Institute has warned the public about a larger than normal shark presence off the coast of St Francis Bay in the Eastern Cape where a whale carcass washed ashore last week. A whale carcass that washed up on Anne Avenue Beach on the St Francis Bay coastline (originally found floating off-shore of Jeffreys Bay on Wednesday afternoon) is believed to have caused a larger than normal shark presence in the area the NSRI said. Sharks were spotted in the vicinity of the Krom River and Anne Avenue Beach off-shore of St Francis Bay close in-shore over the past few days and their perceived increased presence is believed to be directly related to the whale carcass that beached on Thursday and which was then subsequently towed out to sea on Friday it added.It urged bathers paddlers divers sail boarders in the area to be cautious.The carcass was that of a 15-metre Southern Right Whale. It was towed out to sea by a chokka fishing vessel at high tide on Friday afternoon and released for natural disposal .
