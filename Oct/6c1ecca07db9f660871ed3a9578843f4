No-one was hurt in the incident and the blaze was quickly brought under control by firefighters, but the shipping container offices were virtually destroyed, a police official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Around 70 migrants took part in the protest, most of them from Pakistan and Bangladesh, the source said. Police made a dozen arrests.The incident took place at the Moria camp, one of five centres on Greek Aegean islands, which have borne the brunt of Europe's migrant crisis.More than 15,000 migrants are being held on the Aegean islands, pending their return to Turkey under an EU-Turkish agreement reached in March this year. Processing has been held up because many have filed for political asylum.Moria has a capacity for 3,500 people but currently houses more than 5,000.Part of the camp was badly damaged in a fire on September 19 during clashes between migrants and police, and thousands had to be moved out before returning two days later.Nearly 66,000 refugees and migrants are currently stranded in Greece, according to official figures.
