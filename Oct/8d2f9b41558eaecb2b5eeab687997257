The government s decision affects South Africa's domestic capabilities to try genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity as they continue to dismantle the legislative framework (namely the ICC Act) that allows for domestic prosecutions the centre said.The withdrawal also affects the international criminal justice landscape. Given that there are currently no regional courts with criminal jurisdiction victims of these heinous crimes will find no respite domestically regionally and internationally. SALC described the government s move as a retrogressive step that raises great concern about the government s priorities with regard to matters of justice accountability and the prevention of egregious crimes adding that it would be citizens and the victims who would bear the brunt of the government s ill-conceived actions .The centre said it would consider all legal options as it seeks to protect the rule of law and international criminal justice.
