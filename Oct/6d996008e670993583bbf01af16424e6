She was there with me when I was crying. She was the one comforting me so I am really out of words " Mlambo said."I didn't see this one coming. I am still surprised even now. I just want to confront her and ask her why she did this to me. Mlambo said the nanny had always taken good care of Siya and "I treated like my flesh and blood. Every time when I go out I would take her along with me - I wanted to make her feel comfortable at my place.

Immediately when she said Siya is here I felt like flying there to see what was happening " he said.He said he was shocked that the woman they had trusted with their child and treated like family was apparently behind the abduction.The three suspects are being held at the Protea Glen police station and will appear in court soon.
