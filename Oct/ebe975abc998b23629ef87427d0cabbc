Hip-hop heads have been quick to note the shift in hip-hop over the last few years, from strong lyrics to catchy phrases repeated over and over again. Panda, anyone?But while many have been quick to declare the death of hip-hop, rapper Tumi Molekane said that it hasn't really made the genre any worse."Just because people are not rapping as prolifically as they did before, doesn t mean hip-hop has gotten worse. I actually believe there is magic in how young artists can catch a vibe or wave and build something you can feel without a clear formula or science. Amazing," Tumi wrote in a lengthy Instagram post recently.The award-winning lyricist reflected how "the bigger hip-hop got, the less focus went into writing and the art of making words jump". But said that his faith in the craft has been kept alive through a number of young artists."For me it was watching dudes like Iron Solomon, Thesaurus, Illmaculate and NoCando battle that really made me jump at the magic of words again. I felt kindred spirits in their craftiness. You might be watching some guy calling another guy a p*ssy but I see highways of interconnected phrases that all lead to a 'wow'... I hope you guys can come to appreciate the beauty that comes from calling someone a f*g in rhyme form," Tumi added.Cassper also addressed the issue in an interview on 5FM this week, claiming that the game was "chilled" lyrically until the rise of Nasty C in 2015."I remember telling my friend that I hope no one ever hears this kid because it will be over for all of us...I really think he's bringing a new sound to the game. I'm a big fan," Cassper added. </img> Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
