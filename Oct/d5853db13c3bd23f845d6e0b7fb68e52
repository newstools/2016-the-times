The coach of bitter rivals Al Ahly Hossam El-Badry raised eyebrows when he threw his weight behind Zamalek.The two Cairo clubs have a fierce rivalry and El-Badry's endorsement of the old enemy gives further insight into just how desperate the Egyptians are to prevent Sundowns from winning continental club football's Holy Grail.Ahly have the most Champions League titles with eight but Zamalek could add to their five and close the gap on their fellow Cairo side if they win on Sunday.But even this possibility is seemingly a better option for El-Badry than seeing coach Pitso Mosimane's charges leave Egypt with the trophy on Sunday. Zamalek can turn the result in Alexandria. They can do it with hard work and belief to produce a big win against Sundowns on Sunday El-Badry said. Zamalek definitely have a chance and Egypt fully supports them in the final. There is no impossible in football."El-Badry became Al Ahly head coach after Dutch manager Martin Jol capitulated under intense pressure from unhappy supporters and resigned in August.Sundowns take a 3-0 lead to the second leg on Sunday and the Egyptians have gone out of their way to try and unsettle the South Africans.The gamesmanship is expected to escalate as the kickoff to the final approaches. - TMG Digital
