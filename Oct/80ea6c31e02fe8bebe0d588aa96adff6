The politically connected Gupta family's R2.15-billion acquisition of Optimum through Te-geta Resources has been mired in controversy since Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane admitted he went to Switzerland in December to negotiate the sale to Tegeta.Barloworld Equipment said it had filed an application for Optimum's liquidation last month as money due before the mine went into business rescue in August last year was not paid.Barloworld referred to a dispute over amounts due, which are understood to run into millions of rands, but it refused to answer any questions.Optimum had agreed "under protest" to pay part of the debt, Barloworld Equipment said.Glencore put Optimum into business rescue after Eskom claimed R2-billion in penalties for substandard coal supplied to its Hendrina power station and refused to renegotiate a supply contract that runs to 2018.South Africa's biggest banks closed the Guptas' local banking facilities in April, which raised questions about how the acquisition would be funded.The family appeared to have had help from Eskom which, according to the minutes of a meeting, made a decision to give them R587-million to enable Tegeta to deliver coal to its power stations.Eskom denies extending preferential treatment to Tegeta.Doubts also linger over the transfer of Optimum's R1.3-billion held for mine rehabilitation at Standard Bank to a trust account at the Bank of Baroda, it emerged from papers filed by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan explaining why the government could not intervene between the banks and the Gupta family.
