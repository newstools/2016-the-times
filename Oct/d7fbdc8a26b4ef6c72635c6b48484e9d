Speaking to Anele Mdoda on Real Talk, Zinhle seemingly pointed out that introducing Kairo to her current boyfriend, Brendon Naidoo, is not a decision to be taken lightly.Asked how long she would want to date him until Kairo is aware of it, Zinhle admitted to being undecided."I don't know. We'll feel it out."She revealed that, before taking that step, she would have to consider AKA's feelings - out of respect for him, given that he is Kairo's father."Also as a respect thing towards Kiernan [AKA]. I think it's important that he [is] also comfortable enough with [the idea of Brendon playing a] fatherly role to Kairo if he's around," she said."He has to do it without stepping on Kiernan's toes. Kiernan is Kairo's father, and that's that. It is final."DJ Zinhle has played coy on her relationship with Brendon ever since she first admitted earlier this year that she was in a relationship. But she has since become more revealing about her love life. Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
