Expressing regret over the move he called rather for a strengthening of the court from within. Deterring future atrocities delivering justice for victims and defending the rules of war across the globe are far too important priorities to risk a retreat from the age of accountability that we have worked so hard to build and solidify said Ban said at the start of a Security Council meeting on Friday on cooperation between UN and regional organisations on matters of international peace and security. The world has made enormous strides in building a global system of international criminal justice with the International Criminal Court as its centrepiece he added recalling the ground-breaking convictions secured by the ICC and other international tribunals.In his remarks the UN chief said that these and other gains had also been accompanied by setbacks and shortcomings such as prosecutions taking many years and not all countries accepting the court's jurisdiction. Even some of those that do [accept the ICC's jurisdiction] do not always support the court fully he noted.He also noted the concern raised that the court had convicted only Africans despite evidence of crimes in other parts of the world and stressed that such challenges were best addressed not by diminishing support for the ICC but by strengthening it from within.South Africa and Burundi have informed the Secretary-General who is the depository of the Rome Statute of the ICC of their intent to withdraw from the court.According to a UN spokesperson official communication from Gambia the third country which according to reports is intending to withdraw has not been received. I regret these steps which could send a wrong message on these countries' commitment to justice the Secretary-General said.According to ICC the withdrawal will only come into effect one year after the official notification.The ICC s founding Rome Statute sets out the tribunal's jurisdiction over genocide crimes against humanity war crimes and as of an amendment in 2010 the crime of aggression. In addition to jurisdiction it also addresses issues such as admissibility and applicable law the composition and administration of the court investigations and prosecution trials penalties appeal and revision international cooperation and judicial assistance and enforcement.
