This is part of the economic hub's pilot project which seeks to investigate possibilities of keeping the clinics open to residents for extended hours."The city is investigating possibilities of keeping the clinics open to residents for extended hours. Universal access to health is an ideal the city is working towards."Princess Clinic located outside Roodepoort will serve as a pilot project. This is one of 10 resolutions recently taken by members of the mayoral committee and the executive mayor to extend the hours. This arrangement will cater for patients who were unable to go to clinics during working hours for fear of losing their jobs " said City of Joburg spokesman Gabu Tugwana.He said the extended operating hours are due to the increase in demand of health services.The City will on Monday launch the pilot project at the clinic. Operating hours for the clinic are also expected to be announced on the day of the launch.
