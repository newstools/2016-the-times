Chiefs host Komphela's former club Maritzburg United at Soccer City in a Telkom Knockout Last 16 match on Saturday night at FNB Stadium and he was in his element as he tried to communicate the challenges of one of the toughest coaching jobs in South African football."If I were in politics I would say you steal from the statements made by (US presidential candidate) Hillary Clinton regarding the temperament of her counterpart (Donald Trump) " he said to the bemusement of the gathered gallery."You need to have the temperament to deal with this (job) because it is not an easy environment."But the minute you understand the challenge lying ahead then you can cope with ease and deal with the pressure."The wings should not make you feel like now you need to fly in as much as you celebrate. And losses as well."You do not have to then become an ostrich and bury your head under the sand now you cannot hide."After a sluggish start to the season that saw impatient Chiefs fans demanding the coach's head on a platter when things weren't going the club's way Komphela's charges have managed to turn things around and AmaKhosi are now perched at the premiership summit.Bu there are still some cynics who are far from convinced and believe that Chiefs' form is not a true reflection of the team's quality.Many of these critics are predicting that the wheels will eventually come off and Chiefs will return to their poor early season form.Komphela has noted the cynicism and he admitted that it hurt to see the lack of faith in his ability."There are certain books that I just go and read (when he sees the harsh criticism). Just go and read those books and they will define what you are going through."The minute that definition is given you get the comfort and say 'by the way I did not expect any less'."Sometimes it's painful but it's a way of making you grow as a person. Under such as well you try to say less and only request for more time and more strength to do more."Up until that time the questions and the question marks shall forever remain and the less you respond to that the better you focus on the job at hand. The response should be on the field and that's what you have to do." Chiefs back in title hunt Komphela will go a long way towards silencing the cynics if he is able to successfully negotiate a way past United on Saturday.United will arrive at Soccer City harbouring ambitions of avenging the defeat they suffered in the league to Chiefs recently.This game has the making of a gripping encounter and the fans will hope that it lives up to its pre-match biling.Weekend's Telkom Knockout Last 16 fixturesFriday Highlands Park vs Chippa United at Makhulong Stadium (8pm kickoff)Saturday Free State Stars vs Bidvest Wits at Goble Park Stadium (3pm) Kaizer Chiefs vs Maritzburg United at Soccer City (8:15pm) SuperSport United vs Ajax Cape Town at Lucas Moripe Stadium (8:15 pm)Sunday Orlando Pirates vs Golden Arrows at Orlando Stadium (3pm) Baroka FC vs Platinum Stars at Peter Mokaba Stadium (3pm) - TMG Digital
