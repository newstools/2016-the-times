KZN education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane has dispatched a district director to Sinqobile High in Cato Ridge outside Pietermaritzburg to investigate the incident. I can confirm that a case of sexual assault has been opened with the police and we are giving it high priority. Police are looking for the suspects said education department spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa.Mthethwa said the department would plead the victim s case with monitoring body Umalusi to make a special provision for her to either write supplementary exams or use mid-year and trial exams to collate her performance throughout the year. But for now we are giving the victim the parents and the school necessary support and we will be making a psychologist available for her said Mthethwa. The MEC is very disturbed by this incident. It has thrown the learner into a situation beyond her control he said.The pupil reported the incident at the local police station and then went on to write her exam on Wednesday.She was reportedly walking to school alongside a river at around 7am when she was accosted by an unknown man and dragged into the bushes where she was raped.All her belongings including her ID and books were taken.Although the school principal advised against the writing of the exam the pupil insisted and was taken to hospital for treatment afterwards.She is undergoing professional counselling and will undergo psychological assessment to evaluate her ability to sit for the rest of her exams.Education officials have called on members of the public to work with the police to ensure the rapist is brought to book.- TMG Digital/Durban Newsroom
