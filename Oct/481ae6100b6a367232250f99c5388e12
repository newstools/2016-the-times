Bernadette, who has made it through to the finals of the local talent show, has captured the hearts of the nation with her angelic voice.However, the path she has travelled to make her dreams a reality is one filled with pain.In a telling interview with the Daily Voice Bernadette opened up about the circumstances that led her to become a drug mule, and how while in prison, music changed her life.Shortly after her marriage fell apart in 2001, Bernadette had to turn to friends and family for financial help to make ends meet.It was then that one of her friends told her about an "opportunity to make money fast and get rich quick".The single mother admitted that due to desperation she accepted the offer, but said at first she did not know she was transporting drugs.After money started rolling in Bernadette found herself lying to those close to her about the money.And before she knew it she was a "drug mule".It was during her third trip that Bernadette was caught with cocaine and served two years in prison."They kept me in the holding cells for a few days and then I was sent to Casa Circondarial Carcere Milano prison, an all-female prison. I cried every day. I didn t speak Italian, I had no contact with my family and for the first few months they didn t even know what happened to me," she said.After being released from prison Bernadette decided to focus on music and making her mark in the SA music industry.Bernadette will go up against other contestants in the finals where they will compete for the R500 000 prize money.Watch Bernadette's emotionally-charged performance at the semi-finals here: allowfullscreen </img> Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
