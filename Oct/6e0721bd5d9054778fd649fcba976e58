Two key substitutions ensured the victory as Elias Pelembe set up the equaliser for Eleazar Rodgers and Mogakolodi Ngele snatched a last minute victory with a rasping shot from just inside the penalty area.Ajax were 1-0 up at half-time but on the back foot in the second half and are still winless this season, having gone seven games now without a victory.Ajax s goal in the 25th minute came courtesy of an error by referee Victor Gomes. He should have allowed advantage when Mark Mayambela s pass ricocheted off the Wits defence and fell perfectly for Prince Nxumalo to finish right in front of goal but blew his whistle too early for an infringement in favour of the home side.The referee s blushes were spared by Eric Chipeta s free kick, struck sweetly from outside the penalty area, leaving Darren Keet rooted to the spot.Lineman Peter Chauke made the second officiating blunder of the night when he ruled Frank Mhango was offside when he finished from close range in the 37th minute. But he was well on side as he reacted quickest when Ajax goalkeeper Jody February parried a strong header away from Daine Klate.A minute later Ben Motshwari, who played in the centre of defence in place of injury Thabang Monare but often found himself on the right to deliver some telling crosses, should have scored but put his shot wide from close range.Mhango s diving header on the stroke of halftime was well stopped by 20-year-old February, playing on a fourth game of his career.Ajax could have gone 2-0 up when they stole possession and prince Nxumalo bore down on goal on his own thrashing a powerful shot that Keet did well to save.But after thast Wis were in control with Pelembe s cross setting up Rodgers equaliser as he headed home a rebound from about just one metre out in the 69th minute.Pelemeb s free kick set up the winner as Ajax failed to clear properly and Ngele thrashed the ball through a crowd of players to ensure all three points for the visitors and give Wits a rare victory in the Mother City. - TMG Digital
