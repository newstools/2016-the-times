We have applied for this protest and they gave us permission so I don't think there will be any violence. We have no intention of hurting anyone. We hope that there will be a good turn-out today. We want to get the attention of (Higher Education Minister) Blade Nzimande and (President) Jacob Zuma on this issue. We have been in negotiations but nothing seems to happen."However another UP student Tumelo Marema said he was not confident that the march would be peaceful.
