Siphokazi Tyele one of the two survivors of the attack testified at the South Gauteng High Court sitting at Palm Ridge High Court on Wednesday afternoon where she told of the horrific events where at least two men used their hands to penetrate her vagina and anus during the ordeal at the Kensington park in October 2015.Tyele her husband Sizwe and their two friends Jabu Mbatha and Zukisa Kela were accosted by a group of about 10 men while taking a stroll at the park. The women were ordered to lie down next to the dam, while their partners were drowned at gunpoint. Some of the men in the group fled, but two, armed with a knife and gun, remained. One of them knelt in front of me and he took out his penis and tried to insert it inside my vagina. He tried twice or thrice but he could not penetrate me. He then said I must help him insert it. I tried for four or five times but it could not go in because it was too soft the sobbing Tyele told the court.During this, the second man with a gun raped Mbatha a few metres away. When he could not have sex with me he then proceeded to insert two fingers into my vagina and anus. This went on for about five minutes before he got up and they fled Tyele said.The two women then noticed a head of one their partners emerging from the water but there was no response when they tried to talk to him. They ran to nearby houses where they got help.Suspects Thabo Nkala Edmor Ndlovu and Mduduzi Mathibela have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder rape and robbery.TMG Digital/Sowetan
