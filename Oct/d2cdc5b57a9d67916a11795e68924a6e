The hijackers, who operate in Jozini, Manguzi, Ingwavuma, Ndumo and Mhlabuyalingana, recently targeted a vehicle belonging to the Zulu royal family that had been dispatched by Zwelithini to purchase goods in Durban.It was attacked by hijackers in Eshowe. They fired shots at the driver, who managed to flee.Zwelithini made an impassioned plea last week to the police to turn the tide against the spate of car hijackings in northern KwaZulu-Natal."In northern KwaZulu-Natal, ambulances are hijacked with patients inside them. Government vehicles are also hijacked."People are forced at gunpoint to go and fetch their vehicles from police stations, where they keep them out of fear of being hijacked," said the monarch."There is something wrong with our security. We can't live like that. That's not a country when criminals can do as they please."There is no safety at all and people are very worried about the situation," he added.A total of 48 vehicles were reported hijacked in Manguzi from July to October.Sixteen of the stolen vehicles were recovered in Mozambique.Last month six people, including two children, were kidnapped after they were hijacked by five armed suspects in Kosi Bay and then driven to a bushy area and abandoned.They were later found unharmed after a massive joint search by the SANDF, SAPS and two vehicle-tracking companies.The suspects fled in the vehicle and police say they crossed the border into Mozambique.Spokesman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that police were investigating the hijackings in Umkhanyakude.He said the stolen vehicles were smuggled across the border to Mozambique.The spike in hijacking incidents in far-flung rural areas prompted Police Minister Nathi Nhleko to visit Umkhanyakude district on Tuesday to provide feedback after residents raised complaints.They say the hijackers have become so brazen that some of the victims are confronted in their homes and forced to hand over the keys of their vehicles.Nhleko's spokesman, Sandile Ngidi, said the police minister and the top police brass in the province went to the area to reassure the communities that they take cross-border crimes seriously.
