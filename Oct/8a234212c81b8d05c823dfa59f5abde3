Coetzee and his end-year Springbok squad which was announced ob Saturday night gathered in Johannesburg on Sunday for a week of preparations before jetting out to Europe where they will open their tour with a match against a Barbarians side before tests against England, Italy and Wales.Given the fact that the side would be playing in Europe, some predicted that the Europe-based Vermeulen, who plies his trade in France, would be the backbone of Coetzee's side in the year-ending series. However, the No8 who previously played as captain under Coetzee while the two were player and coach at the Stormers, was a clear ommission from the Bok squad that will be finishing off 2016 in the green and gold."It's a big blow [not to have Vermeulen]," Coetzee said before explaining the player's absence from the Bok team since the June series against Ireland in South Africa."It's not a case that I decided I don't want Duane here."Duane Vermeulen said 'Coach, based on my last outing with the Boks, I wasn't fit enough, my reputation actually took a bit of a knock. I feel at this point in time I'm not ready for international rugby'."Further to that, his wife is expecting their second baby and she is due in November... For those reasons he is not available for the end-year tour."Coetzee, who has selected a youthful side with mostly locally-based side - particularly for the Barbarians game, explained his inclusion of players who ply their trade at home."Because of regulations, it is clear that overseas players cannot play outsidr of the international window," the coach said."Therefore we have a 30-man squad that will prepare from tonight (Sunday) to play the Barbarians."The coach expressed his excitement at the inclusion of newbies to the squad which include Lizo Gqoboka (Blue Bulls), Thomas du Toit (Sharks), RG Snyman (Blue Bulls), Roelof Smit (Blue Bulls), Jean-Luc du Preez (Sharks), Uzair Cassiem (Free State Cheetahs), Tian Schoeman (Blue Bulls), Francois Venter (Free State Cheetahs), Rohan Janse van Rensburg (Golden Lions), Sergeal Petersen (Free State Cheetahs), Jamba Ulengo (Blue Bulls) and Cheslin Kolbe (Western Province)."I see it as a great opportunity for a lot of young players to get a taste of international rugby and a taste of the Springbok culture," said Coetzee."This is also a great reward for constant, good performances during Super Rugby and Currie Cup. It's really positive and I'm excited about this."We have a 30-man squad that will work hard to make sure that we get off to a good start on tour. That's important because that first game against the Baabaas will set the platform for the rest of the tour."
