MINUSCA condemned the violence around the central town of Bambari and appealed to the two militia groups behind the clashes to respond to an invitation by President Faustin-Archange Touad ra for talks."Six gendarmes and four civilians lost their lives on Friday morning in an ambush on the Bambari-Grimari road. The day before, clashes between elements of the anti-Balaka and ex-Seleka caused 15 deaths and a number of wounded," MINUSCA said.There was no immediate comment from the government or the militia groups.Central African Republic has been plagued by inter-religious and inter-communal violence since 2013 when the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power, prompting reprisals from the anti-Balaka militia, which draws some of its fighters from the country's Christian population.The level of violence has reduced since an election in February that brought President Faustin-Archange Touad ra to power and was touted as a step toward reconciliation but it remains frequent.
