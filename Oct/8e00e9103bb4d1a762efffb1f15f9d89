I need understanding".She denied that she knew the man in the story, and prayed that the industry would not "destroy" her."Since I've started singing there are people who do not like what I am doing. This person, I do not know where they come from but only God knows. I repeat again, I pray to God this industry does not destroy us. Help me God," she wrote.Babes has grabbed headlines for allegedly skipping church to claims of her glorifying drug use in her songs and apparently raking up a large bill at a salon.She told fans that people who are out to get her can "buy the world" to destroy her name, but she will always be a "child of God".
