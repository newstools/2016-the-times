More than 200 passengers were injured and one was killed when two trains collided between Kaalfontein and Tembisa, on the East Rand, yesterday. The union said it had been trying to secure a meeting with Prasa to discuss railway safety."It is truly tragic that this accident comes after Satawu has for some time been attempting to secure a meeting with the general manager and executive responsible for health and safety at Prasa with no success."Satawu said Prasa had agreed to convene a national health and safety meeting once a quarter and hold monthly meetings at depots."There hasn't been a meeting this year," the union said.Satawu is now demanding an investigation into the cause of the collision.The trade union said it was a "known fact" that Prasa's infrastructure was outdated and in need of upgrading."We are aware that the modernisation project was put on hold. We urge Prasa to finalise [it] to ensure that no more lives are lost unnecessarily."ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics at the scene of the crash said the two trains had collided head-on."Numerous occupants had already begun to climb out of the train and were scattered around the scene."The final injury toll was 242, said Meiring.
