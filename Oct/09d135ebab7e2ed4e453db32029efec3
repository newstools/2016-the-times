She revealed that Malik was whipped after seeing her at the Kaya FM building, however, the two didn't get the chance to speak at the time."We actually never spoke when he saw me. He came to the Kaya FM building, as one of the producers had booked him for an interview. We never spoke and nobody introduced us," she explained."He [Malik] was explaining to somebody that he saw somebody in South Africa with dreadlocks, really beautiful. The girl was like 'is it Claire?' And he was like 'I don't know'. Then she googles my face, [and asks] 'Is this her?' And he's like 'Oh my goodness, that's her'. And then she's like 'She's on Twitter, tweet her'."Claire explained that he subsequently tweeted her, before they moved on to communicate via Skype."We became friends," she said.Despite being friends at the moment, Claire pointed out that she still hasn't officially met him. She also clarified that there is no "love connection" between them."We still haven't met. We've Skyped, we've spoken over the phone, I know a lot of his friends, he knows some of my friends, like the world is small. We have not met."There is no love connection. There is no romance. I think he was really overzealous."Sorry guys, there goes that idea of a perfect romance. Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
