Former Dutch international Stanley Menzo makes his bow on the bench on Wednesday away against Free State Stars a club who have for years been the bogey team for Ajax who have yet to win a match this season. If you are not getting results that means there is something wrong and we have to work on that. It is important we start getting results and get out of the negative spiral Menzo said in his first interview on Monday. At the moment I don t believe the team has a lot of confidence. There is no way a team with just two points can have confidence You see that in the attitude in the way they play. Some hide a little others get rid of the ball a bit quickly.They need to all feel confident on the ball again. Menzo said there would be no drastic changes to the team s outlook until results had settled but he is expected to insist on more of the Ajax system from the Netherlands with ball circulation a top priority. Ajax is not a team to play the long ball game. We have the ability to play in small spaces because we can play football.Menzo long-standing goalkeeper for Ajax Amsterdam in their glory years takes over from Roger de Sa who quit after Wednesday s home loss to Bidvest Wits.Mich d Avray was temporarily in charge on Saturday as Ajax lost at home again this time 2-0 to SuperSport United.- TMG Sport
