Or should that be at the nightclub? The derby has become so commercialised that in some of the sponsors suites the music pumps so loud and a few hundred of the guests party so hard they don t even bother to watch the game.Out on the field, two teams laboured to break each other down in oppressive heat watched by a crowd of around 60 000.If derbies have had a reputation for safety-first football, on Saturday the weather also played a role as both sides attempted to play a high-tempo game in conditions that could only urge a human body toward sluggishness.But a lot of the time the football too was just plain messy. Not Lionel Messi messy. Just messy.In the final 15 minutes, as temperatures cooled, especially Chiefs found some sort of rhythm and created some close chances to ensure an exciting end to the game.Pirates coach Mushin Ertugral had to make a late enforced change, bringing in Riyaad Norodien at left wing for Luvuyo Memela for an undisclosed reason.The 31degreesC heat that the game started in would have made for difficult conditions for the game to be played at any sort of advanced pace.Both sides had their chances early in the first half.In the seventh minute Chiefs left-back Sibusiso Khumalo s cross picked out the run of Mitchell Katsvairo, whose header looped tantalisingly close over the bar.For Pirates, Mpho Makola s free-kick from eight metres outside the box swerved a foot past Itumeleng Khune s right upright.An angled pass from Norodien from near the circle on the left put Thabo Rakhale through the middle, whose first touch was too strong and with the second the winger could not beat Khune.From the half-hour, the game slowed as even both sides players concentration appeared to suffer in the heat, with simple tasks such as completion of passes seemingly becoming onerous.In injury time both sides found some life.Rakhale was played into space on the right of Chiefs area, Lorenzo Gordinho coming across to block. At the other end Ramahlwe Mphahlele made ground on the right and chipped to find Hendrick Ekstein free, who should not have missed his volley a foot over.Early in the second half Gift Motupa struck a solid shot into the arms of Khune.Makola s pass released Tendai Ndoro down the left and strangely the deadly Zimbabwean, with a chance to shoot, opted to find Gift Motupa free on the right, who missed an open target.Again, though, the match drifted into aimlessness. Chiefs supporters would have hoped the introduction of Siphiwe Tshabalala for William Twala after Edward Manqele had replaced Katsvairo would inject some urgency into their frontline.Pirates responded by bringing on Bernard Morrison for Motupa.In a period after the changes the match opened, culminating in Tshabalala s drive that was well off target.Finally there was some real excitement for the supporters who had braved the sun to cheer about. George Lebese s long pass forced Brighton Mhlongo to come out of his area and head. But only as far as Ekstein, whose attempted chip at goal was cleared by Happy Jele.Lebese picked up the loose ball and his powerful strike was kept out by Mhlongo. - TMG Digital Sport
