Nonhle explained to TshisaLIVE on Wednesday that she got to a point in her life and career where she no longer wanted to "present entertainment and gossip shows"."I grew up and changed my focus. Now I'm exploring a new side of myself. I've been in this industry for a very long time and I want to do something different and make a real difference in people's lives," Nonhle said.That is why Nonhle decided to start a support group for mothers called Yummy Mummys, which aims to help and empower woman.The star took to Instagram on Wednesday to congratulate Bonang Matheba on a new presenting gig and revealed that she has retired from the industry."Shout out to Bonang who's holding it down proper in this presenting game...I'm so proud of her. I have retired and I'm happy the industry is in good hands," Nonhle wrote.But that doesn't mean that Nonhle won't possibly return to TV screens in the future."I really want to do a show that focuses on mothers and their issues. We have a lot of youth-focused shows but no real shows about dealing with the struggles and challenges that come with being a mom. If I return, it would probably only be for a show like that," she added. Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
