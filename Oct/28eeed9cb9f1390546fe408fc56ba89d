While Downs were the toast of the town after they landed in Johannesburg with the African Champions League trophy on Wednesday the Boks were on the other side of town planning for their overseas tour.The Boks will take on the Barbarians England Italy and Wales next month.Bok assistant coach Johann van Graan born and bred in Pretoria beamed at the mention of his city's football club and said the national rugby side can draw inspiration from Masandawana s continental exploits. The sky is the limit Van Graan said quoting the popular Sundowns slogan. We as the Springboks have spoken about it what a fantastic achievement. Sundowns feat brought back the assistant coach s own childhood memories of watching the Brazilians in action in Pretoria. I come from Pretoria and have been very privileged to have been a part of the Bulls a few years ago."With Sundowns I remember as a little boy watching Sundowns play at Loftus [Versfeld] for the first time a few years back he remembered. I still remember getting a signed Sundowns ball which is still in my cupboard at home."As a Pretoria boy I always followed Sundowns and SuperSport United. Witnessing Sundowns triumph and also the recent 5-0 One-Day International (ODI) series win by the Proteas against the Australian cricket side is something that the Bok management hopes will rub off on the Bok side that has had an indifferent year. It is brilliant to get some positive news a winning team said Van Graan. It is fantastic to just see people enjoying winning and enjoying something positive."Well done to them. From the Springboks side [we say] what a fantastic achievement. The Proteas as well if I can mention them they beat Australia 5-0."As sports people we like to encourage people and give hope. They (Sundowns and Proteas) have given hope to people and that is what we would like to do. - TMG Digital
