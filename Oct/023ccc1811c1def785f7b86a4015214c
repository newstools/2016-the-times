Chiefs last beat Pirates in December two years ago but since then have lost twice and drawn twice.The match-up is the first since the two clubs were drawn together in the first round of the Nedbank Cup in March in a game that Pirates won with a Tendai Ndoro double.That match marked Soccer City taking over as the venue most used for the derby with 61 matches between Chiefs and Pirates played there compared to 60 for Orlando Stadium which is where the clubs first met almost five decades ago.Over the last 10 head-to-head clashes Chiefs have won three to two for Pirates.But half of the recent meetings have ended in draws reflecting how competitive the encounter is.Overall Chiefs have won 67 of the past clashes compared to 38 for Pirates with 49 draws and five matches abandoned.Chiefs lead the goal count 208 to 168 with Pule Ntsoelengoe as their top scorer on 19 while Jomo Sono s nine is the record for Pirates.- TMG Digital
