Captain Hlompho Kekana and substitute Themba Zwane scored within five minutes of each other in the second half to begin the defence of the trophy they won last year.Sundowns were out on the pitch just 36 hours after arriving at OR Tambo Airport to a tumultuous and lengthy welcome and initially looked a little sluggish as they looked back to get back into action but came alive in the second half once Khama Billiat had come on for the injured Yannick Zakri.Billiat injected the requisite energy and allowed Sundowns to overshadow their visitors after a tepid first 45 minutes.But it was another substitute Zwane who made the incisive contribution, setting up the first and scoring the second goal.The first came after 65 minutes as Zwane cut across the face of goal before unselfishly setting up Kekana for a rasping shot to break the deadlock.Asavela Mbekile stripped Polokwane City of possession five minutes later, set up Thapelo Morena who hit a square pass for Zwane to tap in as the visiting defence were caught ball-watching. We should be proud of ourselves putting in this kind of performance week in and week out, Kekana said as he accepted his man of the match award.There were six players from the Sundowns line-up that played in Alexandria on Sunday night and annexed the Champions League title but also fresh legs in Thursday s line-up with the likes of recent signings Morena, Sibusiso Vilakazi and Zakri, who were not registered for the continental club competition.Vilakazi looked dangerous in some of the early moves but was later taken off and Zakri showed some deft moves but was too selfish in his decision making. But in the first half Sundowns never came close to troubling Polokwane City goalkeeper George Chigova.At the other end, Kennedy Mweene was also under employed with the visitors twice trying to test him from range but being hopelessly off-target.Polokwane City, who had not previously ever won a single Telkom Knockout game, were outclassed in the second half and despite bringing on three strikers to try and turn the tie around never made any decent effort in the second half. - TMG Digital
