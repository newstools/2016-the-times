Dunamis was born with a heart condition called Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, which left the left side of his heart 'critically underdeveloped' and, therefore, he had to go straight to ICU after he was born.This was followed by heart surgery that he had to undergo a week after birth, which, according to Ntombi is "considered to be one of the most complicated in the world."Ntombi revealed that this mournful experience made her realise that she is not in control of what happens to her and maintains that she will not live her life in fear."I've accepted that it was God's will, so I'm not scared to have another child," she told TshisaLIVE during an interview recently."If God wants me to have another baby, I will have one. And if he doesn't want me to, I won't. It's God's will, you can't change that. What's meant to happen, will happen, whether you like it or not. So yes, I would do it again."On the day of his death in December last year, Ntombi paid an awfully heartfelt tribute to her son on Instagram, commending him for fighting "a battle of many men.""He was a silent prophet who ministered the word and saved many souls without ever uttering a word...therefore as a family we believe that his purpose was fulfilled. He has taught us a lot as a family and brought us even closer to God. We thank the Almighty for allowing us the opportunity to be blessed by the life of #Dunamis. He was indeed the #DunamisPower #GodsWarrior," she wrote.
