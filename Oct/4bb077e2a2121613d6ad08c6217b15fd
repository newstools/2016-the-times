That s according to African National Congress Women s League (ANCWL) secretary-general Meokgo Matuba who on Friday demanded that government must ensure that it assists in developing black-owned print media houses of which 50 % of that must be women-owned .To achieve this she urged the ANC-led government from the national to the local level to channel all its advertising to community media and small commercial media which are black-owned . The dismantling of white-owned print media oligopoly in South Africa is long overdue said Matuba.She added that while she supported the ANC position on the freedom of expression in the context of a diverse media environment the league is still to be convinced that South Africans will get objective reporting from the media sector which is still dominated by those who for many years have been the allies of the apartheid super-structure providing rationale and intellectual support to the apartheid system . These allies of the apartheid regime will be easily co-opted by the apartheid beneficiaries to advance regime change agenda and undermine the democratic decision of over 62% of voters who in 2014 chose the ANC as political party to lead in South Africa said Matuba.As the print media is at the centre of the battle of ideas she opined it cannot be allowed to continue being a wholly white-owned subjective determiner of the public agenda and opinion .
