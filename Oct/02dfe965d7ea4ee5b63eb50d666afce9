The claims were carried in a story in the Sunday Times which also said the Gupta-linked company had scored millions from state-owned companies for work it never did .On Tuesday Sexwale who is its independent non-executive chairman said that although the alleged matters took place last year before I joined the company in April of this year I should initiate an independent investigation in order to fully test the veracity of these allegations .He noted that the main thrust of the Sunday Times article seems to revolve around alleged pre-knowledge by a member/members of Trillian concerning the replacement of former finance minister Nene by President (Jacob) Zuma with minister Des van Rooyen . In such a situation if true it would be extremely alarming and would require a convincing explanation to the nation as to how that which was only supposed to be known by the president became known in business circles including Trillian said Sexwale an African National Congress stalwart. The monster of corruption must not be allowed to take root and overwhelm the good work achieved since 1994 .The company had on Sunday denied that the Gupta family had any shareholding or other interest whatsoever in Trillian and Sexwale reiterated this on Tuesday saying: The company is not Gupta-owned and makes the share register of Trillian Holdings available for public scrutiny .
