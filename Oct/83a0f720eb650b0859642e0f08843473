Posting a picture of herself on Instagram, Unathi said that she is always asked about her looks."Please allow me to crush on myself today. FLAWS AND ALL! I get asked why is your hair natural? Why don't you fix your teeth? "But instead of getting hurt by the comments, she said she has decided to appreciate her appearance, not just for herself but for her daughter."Firstly I just love the way God Made me! Truly! Secondly how do I teach my daughter that she is beautiful and enough if I look nothing like her! You are enough queen!" via GIPHY
