These were the words of Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng while delivering an O.R Tambo Lecture in Johannesburg on Thursday evening.Mogoeng said he was inspired by Tambo's selflesness and humbleness."You can't not ask yourself what would OR have done in the[current] circumstances."Of central importance is what would he have done?"."It is the betrayal of OR Tambo's legacy to be politically correct where courage is called for " said Mogoeng.He said that the possibility of the country being downgraded to junk status should be avoided like a mamba.
