There are major changes afoot at SABC radio stations, specifically Metro FM, as plummeting listenership continues its downward spiral.City Press is reporting that Metro FM management has been forced to reshuffle presenters with some of the new talent set to be "farmed" out to other shows.The paper is reporting that one of the major shows affected is Whose Show Is It Anyway? with Somizi Mhlongo, Khanyi Mbau and Ntombi Mzolo.It's believed that the presenters are going to be given slots with some of the 'older' talent at the station, including Glen Lewis, Unathi Msengana and Bonang Matheba.The paper further claims that this has caused some tension in the ranks, with some people threatening to quit.TshisaLIVE last week revealed that Metro FM listenership figures were down 2 million. From January to June 2016 audience numbers were sitting on around 4million as opposed to 6million from July to December 2016.However, a new measurement system has been implemented and sources say this could have an affect on the figures. Final numbers for TV and radio audience figures are expected to be released at the end of November.Somizi, Khanyi and Ntombi's show has been under review since the threesome got the gig. Sowetan revealed that the SABC pledged to investigate and work with the presenters after an extraordinary amount of complaints about the show.
