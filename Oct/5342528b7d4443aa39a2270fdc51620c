Let s go to O.R. Tambo Airport and welcome back home our history-making heroes he said. Sundowns deserve the red carpet which we are going to roll out for them. They are true ambassadors of our Rainbow Nation they have made the entire Mzansi proud and football fans must show their appreciation on this glorious occasion. Mosimane's charges scaled heights last seen in 1995 when Orlando Pirates won the tournament.Chimhavi said the nation s soccer lovers should set aside club loyalties and celebrate Sundowns. Let s show our undivided appreciation put aside club affiliation because this accomplishment is not for an individual or for Sundowns only he said. What Mamelodi Sundowns did should be relished by the entire country. These are moments to be savoured by all patriotic South Africans and I will be there with some of my (Safa) executive committee members to welcome our gallant soldiers."Today we stand on top of the continent thanks to Masandawana!!
