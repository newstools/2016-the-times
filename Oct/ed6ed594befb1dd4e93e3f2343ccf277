Julius took to the hot seat on Anele Mdoda's show, Real Talk, when she asked him if he thinks he has matured over the years.A candid Julius said no, but he has learnt many lessons."It's all part of the growth. I used to say (when I was) in the youth league that we are rough diamonds. And what we are going through is a polishing state. Even now say I wouldn't say I have matured. I'm still learning and appreciating the politics of South Africa and the world."Despite the hard lessons that he has had to learn, Julius says it is knowing the end game that is of the utmost importance."If you have a mission, something that burns you on the inside, they can call you all names. They can throw all types of insults. They can try to delay you. It's okay. as long as you have an appointment with the future you don't care what happens. You have to make it to that appointment with the future."Julius said his involvement in politics was from the age of nine. And when Anele questioned whether he ever gets sick of it, the EFF leader said that it is all he knows."You can't divorce me from politics. That's my life. I tell a lot of people that there's nothing I've done except politics from the age of nine. I didn't play soccer. You know when I grew up in the township, that didn't happen with me. (play soccer) I couldn't do gambling...Someone was asking me 'can you play chess.?' I can't even play the simplest game. Nothing."You can watch the full interview here: </img> Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
