The MKVA leader told the Sowetan he will take his family for counselling to help them deal with the trauma and depression they suffered as a result of the nude photo which was shared on social media platforms on Friday."My wife and daughter who is at the university are both traumatised by this picture. I'm a family man with kids and you can imagine what the picture might have done to them. I will obviously have to take them for counselling " he said.The picture shows a person who looks like the ANC NEC member leaning on a table in his full glory reading what looks like newspapers.Maphatsoe said: "I arrived home yesterday from Cape Town and woke up in the morning to prepare for the general council. When I was with my wife I started receiving calls from comrades and senior leaders who said 'comrade did you see this thing on social media platforms. I said 'what are you talking about because I don't even know how to use social media and don't even have an account?'"They said 'there is a picture of you.' Fortunately I have a thick skin " he said.Maphatsoe said he will not take legal action."...Even President Jacob Zuma said as a leader you must always be prepared to be insulted and booed. So I will not sue or press criminal charges against that person. I'm a Christian and I'm from a Christian background so I'm not vindictive."Read the full story on SowetanLIVE
