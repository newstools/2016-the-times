Speaking to the paper on the second anniversary of his son's death, Sam said he knows who killed Senzo but will not expose the man in the media.He said that his son had been visiting him in dreams over the last few months and told Sam who his killer is."He indicates to me who killed him," Sam said.He said that he has told police about the dreams but they have yet to arrest the man."I told the cops what my son shows me in my dreams and what the sangomas have told me. The cops know who the killer is. If they don't act, I will do it in my way," Sam added.Sam has apparently consulted "strong sangomas" who, he believes, will help bring the man to justice."I am in contact with strong sangomas who will deal with the killer of my son. I have waited patiently to hear that cops have arrested the suspect but I have not heard any word from them," Sam said.South Africans have taken to social media to pay tribute to the late Bafana Bafana captain.Sam Meyiwa has again called on Kelly Khumalo, who was in the house when the incident occurred, to come clean on the details of what happened that night."He died in Kelly's arms at their house and I expect her to know and tell the truth," Sam said.Although Kelly has not spoken about the incident at length, she did tell Anele Mdoda in a recent interview on Anele's Real Talk show, that she wants to tell the nation what happened."Dude, if you ask me, the investigation thing is driving me crazy, because people want to know and I want to get this out of my system and move on with my life... At the end of the day, I'm one person who wants people or even the country to know what happened," she said.Senzo was shot in October 2014 at Kelly s mom s house in Vosloorus, Gauteng.
