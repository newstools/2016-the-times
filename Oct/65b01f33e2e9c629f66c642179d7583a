Sundowns returned to SA to a heroes' welcome at OR Tambo International Airport on Wednesday morning after winning the African Champions League in Egypt on Sunday.Mbalula who calls himself Father Christmas said while he cannot compete with the club's billionaire owner Patrice Motsepe's deep pockets he would give the Brazilians "a little something" in recognition of their achievement."We do not roll out the red carpet for mediocrity we only roll it out for champions " Mbalula said to wild howls of laughter."I do not have Ntate Motsepe's money. Ntate Motsepe has given the players all the dollars they have won in the Champions League."And I am happy about that because you (Motsepe) are joining me as Father Christmas. I have got a cheque here but it is not a big cheque."It's a very small cheque and I am giving you R700 000. You will all share it even those players who did not play because you are a team."Motsepe announced a few days ago that he would award the entire Champions League winnings (R20million) to his players and the team's technical staff.Mbalula has been in a generous mood this year and has already rewarded several South African sportsmen and sportwomen who have represented the nation's flag with distinction around the the world.- TMG Digital
