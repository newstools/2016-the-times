Downs supporters stepped off the bus and in characteristic South African fashion burst into song marching down the road to their accommodation at the Grand Royal Hotel Alexandria and attracting the cellphone camera interest of onlookers.Even Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba couldn't resist the colourful spectacle.At the hotel they were met by a traditional Egyptian pipe band and dancer.The supporters were treated like celebrities being interviewed by the local media.Mashaba travelled with the supporters also as a guest of Sundowns where the Brazilians must protect a commanding 3-0 lead from the first leg in Atteridgeville in Sunday night s second leg at the Borg El Arab Stadium.The last time a South African team travelled to Alexandria in search of a major trophy was when Bafana Bafana were based in the cosmopolitan ancient city on the Mediterranean coast for the first round of the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations.Downs coach Pitso Mosimane was assistant to Bafana coach Ted Dumitru - who had at the time brought an experimental undercooked squad to the finals in Egypt - and the national team bombed out in the first round without winning a game or scoring a goal.That performance was symptomatic of a period of underachievement for South African football which is only just starting to show signs of life again with Orlando Pirates run to the continental finals in 2013 (Champions League) and in 2015 (Confederation Cup) and with Downs final appearance.Sundowns 3-0 advantage gives them every chance of going one better than Pirates did when the Bucs were overwhelmed by Al Ahly and a boisterous 35 000 crowd in Cairo in 2013 to lose 2-0 having drawn 1-1 at home.It would be a triumphant and perhaps symbolic return to Alexandria for Mosimane which could revitalise SA football.Temperatures in Alexandria are at a hot but not unbearable 26degreesC to 28degreesC as the country that encompasses the Nile River's entry into the Mediterranean at the far northern reach of the Sahara Desert approaches its winter and a football friendly 15degreesC to 17degreesC at night.Bustling Alexandria with a population of 4.5 million is arranged along a long beachfront and picturesque harbour area featuring an Ottoman empire-era fort.Founded by the ancient Greek conqueror and king Alexander the Great it once was a seat of learning and technical achievement boasting two wonders of the ancient world its lighthouse and library which no longer exist.It retains a charm stemming from its whispers of an ancient past long since overtaken by a modern city that combines colonial architecture of the era of British rule with its post-independence street cafes thousands of shops that stay open until late into the night new modern library and its museums.It seems an apt place for a team as cultured as Sundowns to win their first African club championship which would be South Africa s first triumph in the competition since Pirates were crowned the country s lone Champions League winners in 1995.* Marc Strydom is in Egypt as a guest of Mamelodi Sundowns - TMG Digital
