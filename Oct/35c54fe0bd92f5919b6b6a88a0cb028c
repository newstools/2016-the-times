Over 2 000 Amcu members who work at Sasol coal mines in Secunda Mpumalanga have been on strike for the past two months demanding a minimum wage of R12 500 a month.Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa praised his members for continuing with the strike without any incidents of violence. We have to continue like this so that we can give no room for the employers to declare the strike unprotected he explained to the workers in IsiXhosa.Mathunjwa joined the workers with his vice president Sanele Myeza and general secretary Jeff Mphahlele to encourage them to continue with their fight for a living wage. We implore the leadership of this company to prioritise settling this matter urgently. We are open to engaging the employer to find a lasting solution. We invite the company to come back to the negotiation table and present their settlement proposal which addresses our members demands said Mathunjwa.He then told management representatives who came to receive the memorandum that he was willing to immediately talk. The representatives took his offer and a meeting was convened to find common ground between the union and employers.In 2014 Amcu went into the history books when it staged a five-month strike in the platinum sector.
