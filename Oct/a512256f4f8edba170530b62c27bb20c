Nche has been a marauding performer in the loose but he has conceded 12 penalties a tournament high but that was not the reason for his omission. According to Smith Nche suffered a leg injury last week which was the reason he has been benched for the match. Charles Marais replaces Nche. It was the only change to the squad that pulverised the Golden Lions 55-17 in last weekend s semi-final. Centre Nico Lee and flank Paul Schoeman who both suffered ankle injuries last week were cleared to play.
