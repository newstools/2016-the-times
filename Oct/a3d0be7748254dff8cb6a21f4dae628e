TshisaLIVE earlier reported the SABC had 'banned' her song after concerns it promoted drug use.The SABC has denied this, explaining that no song is banned at the public broadcaster."It goes through a selection process and individual radio stations either reject it or it is playlisted. There are numerous reasons a song can be rejected. I don't know if this song has been rejected as that is a matter for the stations," said the SABC's Kaizer Kganyago.Speaking to Sowetan, Babes reiterated the song is about a car and not drugs."I'm talking about a car that I want to buy for my father. I didn't know that there's a drug called Mercedes."Watch her explain it in her own words: "I'm talking about a car that I want to buy for my father. Since I was young my father liked Mercedes. Even now. When it comes to music, many artists fight and since I have arrived other female artists give me an attitude. When I greet them they say 'yaah' Music shouldn't make us fight. I didn't know that there's a drug called Mercedes and music. So people thought the song was about the drugs and the song is about me." </img> Find the hottest celebrity and entertainment news on TshisaLIVE or follow TshisaLIVE on Facebook and Twitter.
