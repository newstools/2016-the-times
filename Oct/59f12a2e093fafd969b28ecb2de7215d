Hawks spokesman Captain Lloyd Ramovha said the suspects aged between 19 and 52 were arrested near Grabouw on Friday. The arrest occurred when a Mitchells Plain-bound Toyota Fortuner towing a supposedly broken down Corsa bakkie on a trailer was spotted and pulled over near Grabouw. The resultant search of the vehicles led to the seizure of over 100 000 tablets and 1kg of heroin concealed in apparent false compartments of the Corsa Ramovha said. The suspects are expected to appear in the Grabouw Magistrate s Court on Monday to face charges related to drug trafficking. R7.9 million heroin bust at Mozambique border post
