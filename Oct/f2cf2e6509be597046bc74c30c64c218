Mashaba travelled with Sundowns to Egypt at Mosimane's invitation last week and the Bafana coach was present when Sundowns beat Zamalek 3-1 on aggregate to win the CAF African Champions League in Alexandria.The gesture was seen as an olive branch to Mashaba after the two coaches exchanged barbs in the media over the past few weeks.Mashaba was one of the many people Mosimane thanked on his arrival at OR Tambo International Airport yesterday. He squashed any suggestions of bad blood between the two coaches."Bra Shakes has been with us all the time," Mosimane said. "Bra Shakes was in all our team talks, breakfasts and lunches."What you read in the newspapers, don't take it [seriously]. Take what is genuine - we are together."Tension between the two coaches was widely reported, particularly during the times when Mosimane wanted his over-stretched players to be excused from national duty. - TMG Digital
