The statute together with the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act of 2002 (Implementation Act) enjoins South Africa to arrest people who are wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes and to surrender such persons to the ICC.On Thursday International Relations and Co-operation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane signed an instrument of withdrawal from the ICC.Justice Minister Michael Masutha confirmed on Friday that a Bill proposing the repeal of the Implementation Act will soon be tabled in Parliament.The LHR said on Friday such a move will leave the victims of the world s most heinous crimes with no voice and no place to seek justice. South Africa has played an extremely important role in the development of the court and the expansion of universal jurisdiction for international crimes the organisation said in a statement.As a leader on the African continent South Africa had been instrumental in creating an international court which would ensure that crimes against humanity had no place in the 21st century the LHR said. While far from a perfect institution the ICC has played a role in the investigation of gross human rights violations committed by governments particularly in Africa. By committing to withdrawal South Africa was joining the likes of Burundi and Rwanda in withdrawing from international institutions. African victims have as much of a right to access justice as heads of state have to due process LHR said.Freedom Under Law said the announcement was but one more instance of an executive increasingly contemptuous and brazen in its disregard for the rule of law.Far from it being an international treaty that sources South Africa s obligations in respect of the ICC it was South Africa s own democratically enacted law the Implementation Act that governs all relevant undertakings assumed by the South African government Freedom Under Law said. There can be no lawful purported withdrawal from the Rome Statute of the ICC while the Implementation Act is in force adding that Maite-Mashabane had acted unlawfully and unconstitutionally in notifying the United Nations of South Africa s intention to withdraw from the ICC.
