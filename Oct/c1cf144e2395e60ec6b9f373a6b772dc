I struggled a lot in the race and had some problems, but I really wanted it," he said.Riders complained that the track, newly repaved, was draining unevenly after rain, creating alternating wet and dry patches.Much of the race was a duel between Rossi and Dovizioso's Ducati teammate Andrea Iannone, who returned for the first time since suffering a vertebrae fracture in a crash last month.France's Johann Zarco won in Moto2 to become the first man to repeat since the championship was introduced in 2010.He became the first French rider to win more than one championship in Grand Prix Racing, according to MotoGP.
