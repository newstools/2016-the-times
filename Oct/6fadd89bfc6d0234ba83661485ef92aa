 We can confirm that the full amount of the prepayment to Tegeta has been recovered via coal delivered to Eskom by the end August 2016. During this period of time Eskom had sufficient security in place to cover any potential default by Tegeta Eskom said in a statement on Wednesday evening. Eskom concluded a contract with Tegeta to supply 1 250 000 tons of coal from April to September 2016 and obtained approval to extend the contract with Umsimbithi to supply 540 000 tons from June to September 2016. These two contracts in our view sufficiently addressed the winter shortfall and security of supply risk relating to coal procurement the electricity provider said.It added that the Eskom contract with Tegeta had been concluded on the basis of an off-take agreement between Optimum Coal Mine and Tegeta. Hence the prepayment was paid to the contracting party being Tegeta. Optimum in turn supplied the coal to Tegeta and received payment from Tegeta. Eskom did not have a contractual obligation to pay Optimum Coal Mine as asserted by the business rescue practitioners. Eskom said these transactions had enabled it to commit to no load shedding during the winter peak period which it said was a significant commitment to the country. An internal audit review has been conducted and concluded that the process followed for the procurement and prepayment complied with the Public Finance Management Act and National Treasury regulations. Furthermore Eskom has not been approached by the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI). Should the DPCI approach Eskom Eskom will cooperate with the investigations the parastatal said.
