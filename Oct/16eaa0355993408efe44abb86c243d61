New York's Museum of Modern Art announced that it had acquired the original set of 176 emojis by a Japanese phone company for its collection, which will now hang alongside masterpieces by Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock.The images of smiley faces, food and cats were created in 1999 for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.The set was designed by Shigetaka Kurita and each emoji is made in a grid that is just 12 x 12 pixels.Paola Antonelli, a senior curator at MoMA's department of architecture and design, said part of the museum's mission was to collect and display timeless art and design."Emojis as a concept go back centuries to ideograms and hieroglyphics, enabling us to draw this beautiful arch that covers human history," he said.The emoji display comes six years after MoMA added the @ symbol - used in e-mail addresses and on social media - to its collection, citing its "design power".The faces in emojis have grown more racially diverse in recent years and 11 new emojis representing female professionals have been added, thanks to a proposal from Google.New emojis are added regularly.
