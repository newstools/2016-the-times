We are doing this quite energetically; we are talking to people all over and the response is actually promising. He said the ANC had written back to the 101 veterans and urged them to approach the party in an organised and structured fashion. The letter he added was authored by the Reverend Frank Chikane.The ANC was undergoing a process of introspection and talking to people. Veterans of the ANC must be helpful in that situation and not sulk in the sidelines he said.Acknowledging the party faced problems Mantashe said: You can t bottle feelings of people when there are problems. We are going through a period where people will explode from time to time and that process must help the ANC heal itself.
