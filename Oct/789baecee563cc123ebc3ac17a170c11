This is despite all the odds stacked against them.With months of schooling lost after the Vuwani residents' riots earlier this year over the incorporation of the area into the newly established Malamulele municipality, the matric pupils have had to ensure they kept up with the school programme.In May communities from around Vuwani went on the rampage after their Constitutional Court bid to reverse their incorporation into the new municipality was dismissed. Schools were torched and the education of 2000 matrics and nearly 51000 others was brought to a halt.The Basic Education Department sent the matrics to three two-month learning camps.It was there that pupils devised their own study catch-up programmes, which were driven by local school principals, with the support of the police and traditional leaders.These programmes continue today, with pupils having formed night-time study groups, which work from classrooms not destroyed in the violence.Other affected pupils began taking catch-up lessons only when the violence ended in August.Maligana Wilson Secondary School matric pupil Moses Malimedzhe, 26, is happy he is about to complete his schooling. He dropped out of Grade 10 in 2011 to support his family of eight after his father lost his job."I was able to return to school only in 2013 after my father's pension was paid out. It has been a struggle for me to be where I am today. I believe I can rise above my poverty. I need this education."As with many others, he packs his toothbrush, toothpaste, face cloth and a bar of soap on Mondaybecause he will not be returning home.After often studying until midnight , at 6:30am they all brush their teeth, wipe their faces and then study for one more hour before "normal" school starts.Education spokesma n Elijah Mhlanga said: " We had psychosocial challenges in the camps, with pupils becoming homesick as they had never been away from home before. It affected family structures, with teachers having to be away from families."
