As violent protests continued to rock the nation this week, Loyiso took to Twitter to vent his anger and frustration at the situation, and the president's supposed timid response to the student's plight.I don't think the motherfucken president understands that these motherfucken fees must fall. Loyiso Gola (@loyisogola) October 19, 2016I don't think the motherfucken president understands that these motherfucken fees must fall.Loyiso's comments came after the comedian was caught in a protest "shut down" in Braamfontein, Johannesburg on Tuesday evening; and only hours after president Jacob Zuma told a meeting in Pretoria that the government cared for students, and so their protests should not lead to violence."We are a caring government. We are sympathetic to the message from the students because we share the understanding of the need to ensure that children of the poor and the working class obtain higher education. There is therefore no need for violence and the kind of protests we have seen, which give an impression that students think government is opposed to what they are asking for. We are not opposed to the call, we support it. It is a noble call," the Daily Maverick quoted the president as saying.This is of course not the first time that Loyiso has taken to social media to lambaste the president.In August, the comedian took to Twitter to accuse the president of being selfish and not thinking of anyone but himself - amidst reports of the Hawks conducting an investigation into Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and allegations of state-capture by President Zuma."Zuma doesn't think of other people... he only thinks of himself. Go away, man," Loyiso tweeted to his followers in Xhosa.Loyiso had previously been warned by followers that he should be careful about publicly criticising the president.He responded to this by pointing out that he has always been outspoken about the president- and actually doesn't "give a f*ck".
