Chiefs weathered a strong first half showing by their unfancied opponents and then an electric storm followed by floodlight failure with 83 minutes played, that caused a 40-minute delay.By the time Keegan Buchanan hammered home the final penalty for a 4-2 shootout win, it was 11.30pm at the end of a long night of football.It was a hollow win for Chiefs as coach Steve Komphela admitted afterwards, saying the only positive was the penalties. I knew it would be a difficult night when our bus broke down on the way to the stadium, he added after they arrived in a minibus. But it was certainly not a game without incident.The drama began as early as the first 70 seconds when Maritzburg captain Bevan Fransman was disposed by Michelle Katsvairo and the Zimbabwean striker was able to streak away at goal, only to put wide his shot as debutant goalkeeper Bongani Mpandle did well to cut the angle.Maritzburg had a legitimate-looking penalty claim in the 17th minute when Kgotso Moleko slipped under pressure from Kwanda Mngonyama and clearly the ball struck his outstretched arm but referee Thando Ndzandzeka did not give it, to the angered exasperation, and then bemusement, of Maritzburg coach Ernst Middendorp.Pule Eksteen blasted a shot over the top in the 21st minute when a gap opened up in front of him on the edge of the penalty area in what turned out to be Chiefs last chance of the first half.After that it was Maritzburg who were bossing matters with debutant Luyanda Ntshangase skinning Mulomowandau Mathoho and forcing Itumeleng Khune into a brave save as he put his body in the way of a close-in effort.That 32nd minute effort was followed 120 seconds later by Denis Weidlich stealing the ball off George Lebese around the halfway line, then racing unchallenged to the edge of the box and unleashing a cracker that gave Khune no chance but rebounded firmly off the upright.Ntshangase, who is just 19 years old and a product of the Maritzburg academy, hit his shot over five minutes before half-time and right on the whistle a corner was poorly defended by Chiefs allowing Brian Onyango to come through with the goal at his mercy but he failed to get his head to a glorious chance.But near the start of the second half, Onyango lost concentration in the heart of the visitors defence and allow the lethargic-looking Lebese to sneak in behind him and create a good opportunity only to pull his effort wide of the goal.Flying fullback Sibusiso Khumalo had a good effort from a tight angle after 54 minutes to force a good save from Mpandle.Maritzburg s German import Weidlich had another golden chance with 25 minutes to go, emerging unmarked at the back post to hit a corner goal ward but Khune tipped it over the crossbar.With 10 minutes to go, Chiefs fullback Moleko headed butted Moyo but referee Ndzandzeka missed the incident that should have left Chiefs down to 10 men.The goalless game was headed to extra time when the floodlights failed in the 83rd minute, just minutes after the heavens had opened up and unleashed a blustery electric storm over the stadium.Lebese s cross at the start of extra time allowed William Thwala a chance as he sprinted into towards the back post but he could not get a decent touch. Substitute Siphiwe Tshabalala then cracked a characteristic left-footed drive just wide of the target in the last decent opportunity of the game. - TMG Digital
