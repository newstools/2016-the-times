The case brought urgently last week is scheduled to be heard on Tuesday November 1.It is as yet unclear whether the other parties to the case opposition parties the DA EFF UDM and COPE would agree to the postponement.Former public protector Thuli Madonsela s state capture investigation looked into whether there was an inappropriate relationship between the president the Gupta family and other state officials.Though Mentor s allegations have been in the public domain for some time Zuma s response to her court papers could be the first time he responds under oath to the allegations.He never answered questions sent by Madonsela saying he had not been given enough time to do so.It was on this basis that he went urgently to court the day before the report was due to be released to interdict the release.However he could also respond to Mentor by saying the substance of her allegations was not relevant to the interdict case.Mentor filed her affidavit on Tuesday. In it she confirmed that the Gupta family had offered her a Cabinet post in exchange for furthering their business interests. Crucially she put the president on the scene.In her affidavit she says: As I was leaving the president entered the room. I recounted the offer and advised him that I could not in good conscience accept the offer. The president responded and said It s okay Ntombazana you have come such a long way in crutches and saw me out. In a letter sent on Wednesday from Zuma s lawyers state attorney Isaac Chowe said Zuma s team would be opposing Mentor s application meaning the exchange of more affidavits. This obviously means that the matter will not be ripe for hearing on Tuesday November 1 2016 he said.Chowe also refers to the latest affidavit from the public protector s office which confirmed that the report was a final report.Because of this the president would be amending what he had originally asked the court to do and also adding to his court papers he said.- TMG Digital/BusinessLive
