The brilliantly outspoken TV personality and singer took to Twitter on Sunday to lash out the industry's decision-makers, urging them to give fans "real entertainment" and to also invest in the "right talent".Without going into detail or dropping any names, Denise began her rant: "One day, the people running this industry of ours will learn to give us real entertainment. But some of us can't stand &amp; watch the bullsh**.""Hire the right talent. Do right by the talent. Put in extra into the budget. Stop trying to be the talent. Stay in your lane."Denise, like many, also believes that copious amounts of money is spent on flying international acts down to South African shores only to do "half the job," while local artists are left hung out to dry."We give to much money and credit to international acts that end up doing nothing but a half job, and don't take care of our own," she wrote.This comes hot on the heels of Future's performance at the 2016 MTV Africa Music Awards on Saturday evening, which left a number fans disappointed at the US hip-hop star.I'm disappointed really.
