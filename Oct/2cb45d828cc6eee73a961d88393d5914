It's uncertain for how long the parties went on in Mamelodi and Bloemfontein, but two men who were unlikely to overindulge were Pitso Mosimane and Franco Smith.Both are understated characters: Mosimane twice had to stand back for high-profile, highly paid, Brazilian coaches before getting the Bafana job, and Smith has seldom received the respect he deserves.Both are now entitled to bask in the reflected glory of the teams they helped create, inspire and set on their paths to success, but they are unlikely to linger in the limelight.Nevertheless, both can take credit. Smith for producing a team that played exciting and winning rugby, and Mosimane for masterminding a victory over Zamalek.Mortada Mansour, who is chairman of Zamalek FC, ungraciously blamed his club's defeat on sorcery and bad luck. Perhaps he recalled some ancient Egyptian curse, or an Arnold Vosloo revival of the The Mummy.Mosimane was never put off by such scare stories. He knew that Zamalek, comfortable playing before their partisan home fans, would be poor travellers. So Sundowns attacked from the start in the first leg at Atteridgeville.The 3-0 outcome might have surprised even Mosimane but he would have known that such a huge advantage in the second leg would be a bridge too far for Zamalek (they have some beautiful bridges in Alexandria).Borg el-Arab is a pleasant venue for victory.Seventy-four years ago, however, it was the grim, fly-infested military camp in which Winston Churchill went for a swim in the nude, much to the amusement of the onlooking Commonwealth soldiers.That was just before he fired one general, replacing him with a bloke called Montgomery, who went on to chase a German bloke called Rommel all the way out of Africa.That's mostly forgotten history in these parts; new history was made on Sunday in the cool autumn air of an Egyptian night. In the tradition of Montgomery's times, it might be an idea to again invoke place and time and confer a title on the Sundowns coach. "Mosimane of Mamelodi" has a nice ring to it.Sundowns owner Patrice Motsepe could even arrange for the installation of the conqueror of Borg el-Arab at a suitable ceremony during which all protocols would, naturally, be observed.It would be a good excuse for the people of Mamelodi to celebrate a victory that, at least in the eyes of Sundowns devotees, is every bit as historic as the disagreement 74 years ago in the same neighbourhood that was settled close to Borg el-Arab near a little railway station at a place called el-Alamein.And they might even invite Franco Smith to come and share a good township chesa nyama that would put a Free State braai to shame.And, as the son of a history teacher, he would doubtless understand the historical context.
