Sundowns take a 3-0 lead to Sunday night's African Champions League final second leg and Zamalek fans have tried their best to try and unsettle coach Pitso Mosimane's charges.Mosimane revealed this week that frenzied fans in Egypt have gone as far as using social media to issue death threats to the Sundowns players and have utilised Instagram Facebook and Twitter to make their point.But International Relations and Co-operation spokesman Clayson Monyela told Times Media Digital on Thursday they were not perturbed by the fans' actions. The South African embassy in Egypt is working with local authorities to ensure that Sundowns are well looked after from a security point of view Monyela said. Any other thing we hope they (Sundowns) are not distracted from the ultimate goal and keep their focus on the main objective (of winning the Champions League). Egyptian soccer fans are some of the most passionate in the world and they are expected to continue to do their best to intimidate Sundowns even during the match. - TMG Digital
