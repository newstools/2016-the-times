The app shows water users which flag is currently flying at beaches in the Mother City and why. The flags denote poor spotting conditions due to cloud cover shark sightings an indication of water temperature the lunar phase and whether the shark exclusion barrier in Fish Hoek has been deployed or not. It also gives information on weather conditions marine animal activity in the area (such as whales seals dolphins sunfish etc.) the details of amenities on the beaches as well as short surf videos of isolated surf spots covered by the programme that do not have live web-cams in operation .
