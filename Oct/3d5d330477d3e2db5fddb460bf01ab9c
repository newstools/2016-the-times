The absences of Thamsanqa Gabuza, Oupa Manyisa and Tokelo Rantie in his 25-man squad for the November 12 World Cup qualifier against Senegal and a friendly against an unnamed opponent three days later seems to have answered that question.While Belgium-based forward Lars Veldwijk, Bidvest Wits' Daine Klate and Supersport United's Ronwen Williams were deserved inclusions, Mashaba was always going to be at odds defending Manyisa and Gabuza.Manyisa is still trying to recapture his old form while Gabuza is an afterthought in Muhsin Ertugral's selectorial mind at club level.While little is known about Veldwijk, the KV Kortrijk forward who was born in Uithoorn in the Netherlands to a South African father, Mashaba hinted at the 25-year-old being the cure to his team's goalscoring ills.Klate's superlative performances for Wits made him almost impossible to leave out."We've been monitoring Lars since his time with Nottingham Forest before he moved to Belgium. He's a good striker who knows how to hold the ball up and can also score," Mashaba said."We haven't been getting quality balls coming in from the left-hand side and we've seen what Klate's done at Wits and that's his area of expertise."Rantie's absence was too glaring to miss and questions about his desertion were referred to team manager Barney Kujane, who said the SA Football Association was dealing with the matter.
