"Our nation faces a serious crisis. The illegal and violent action of a few have forced campus shut-downs while not enough funding exists to support poor students and the 'missing middle' " the DA said in a statement on Tuesday."Chronic under-funding and a lack of leadership by Jacob Zuma's government has only compounded the problem forcing fee-increases and the tensions which arise as a result. "This has to come to an end if we are to save higher education in South Africa and ensure that the future of young South Africans is not jeopardised." The DA said it wants Universities to re-open without delay and that more funding be made available "so that no person be denied an education because they cannot afford to study".- TMG Digital
