 Most of the applications we received are from university students said NSFAS chief executive Msulwa Daca. This is a concern because the reason for the early opening of applications is to be able to assess all applications early and communicate with the applicants before January 2017. Daca was addressing the media in Pretoria on Monday on the progress NSFAS has made on 2017 applications.Daca said NSFAS had in 2016 supported 480 000 economically disadvantaged students to access universities and colleges. This year alone NSFAS has disbursed loans and bursaries to the tune of R14-billIon. I must emphasise that NSFAS provides both 100 % bursaries and loans to students. Daca said NSFAS provides 70% bursaries and 30% loans.The scheme according to Daca will now convert the loans given to third-year students into bursaries on condition that they meet academic requirements.Daca would not give a figure of how much money the scheme has recouped from previous NSFAS students.There are students who have come forward to pay their loans he said.Daca earlier said that students will no longer need to reapply every year for financial assistance and that NSFAS has introduced a centralised system for all its processes. In 2017 it will be for the first time that the entire NSFAS student population would be on the MyNSFAS system. Under the new system students will not be required to re-apply every year for financial aid . They will only apply for NSFAS once and be funded for the duration of their studies Daca said.Previously students needed to apply for financial aid before every academic year.The benefits of the new system include "the ability to pick up fraud before it happens ensure that money goes to intended beneficiaries .Since opening the centralised system Daca said NSFAS has received more than 195 000 online applications.
